THE GNOSTIC SEVEN-ARCHON PLANETARY SYSTEM
A Reference for Planetary Tradition Mapping
=========================================

Period: 2nd-4th century CE
Primary traditions: Sethian, Ophite, Valentinian
Primary sources: Nag Hammadi Library (discovered 1945), Patristic heresiological reports


I. OVERVIEW
-----------

In Gnostic cosmology, the seven archons ("rulers") are hostile or ignorant
cosmic powers who govern the seven planetary spheres. They were created by
the chief archon, the Demiurge (most commonly called Yaldabaoth/Ialdabaoth),
who in turn was the deficient offspring of the aeon Sophia. The archons
collectively produce heimarmene (fate) -- the deterministic web of astrological
influence that keeps the divine spark trapped within matter.

The soul, descending from the Pleroma (divine fullness) into incarnation,
passes through each archonic sphere and acquires a layer of material
conditioning. After death, the soul must ascend back through these spheres.
At each gate, the archon demands proof of the soul's worthiness to pass.
The Gnostic initiate, armed with gnosis -- knowledge of the archons' names,
their true (inferior) natures, and the correct passwords -- can bypass them
and return to the Pleroma.

The number seven derives from the seven classical "planets" visible to
antiquity: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. This is the
same sevenfold structure found in Babylonian astral religion, Platonic
cosmology (Timaeus), and Hermetic tradition, but in Gnosticism the planetary
rulers are uniformly depicted as adversarial or at best ignorant -- wardens
of a cosmic prison rather than beneficent governors.


II. YALDABAOTH: THE CHIEF ARCHON
---------------------------------

Name: Yaldabaoth (also Ialdabaoth, Saklas ["the fool"], Samael ["blind god"])
Planet: Saturn (the outermost sphere, highest in the geocentric model)
Source texts: Apocryphon of John, On the Origin of the World, Hypostasis of
             the Archons, Pistis Sophia, Irenaeus (Against Heresies I.29-30)

Yaldabaoth is the Demiurge -- the creator of the material world and father
of the remaining six archons. He is born from Sophia's deficient emanation
and, ignorant of the realms above him, declares: "I am God and there is no
other God beside me" (Apocryphon of John; echoing Isaiah 45:5-6).

He is described as lion-faced (Apocryphon of John, long recension) or
serpentine. His association with Saturn follows the ancient identification of
Saturn as the outermost visible planet and the planet of limitation,
constraint, and time -- all fitting the Demiurge's role as cosmic jailer.

Vice/quality: Audacity (authadia), arrogance, ignorance
Personified vice (Pistis Sophia, Hellenized system): Authadia (Audacity)


III. THE SEVEN ARCHONS: SYSTEM-BY-SYSTEM COMPARISON
-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE ON PLANETARY ASSIGNMENTS: The Nag Hammadi texts themselves (particularly
the Apocryphon of John) do not always explicitly assign each archon to a
specific planet by name. The planetary correspondences given below follow the
conventional scholarly reconstruction based on the order of the archons as
listed in the texts mapped onto the standard Chaldean planetary order
(Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun/Venus, Venus/Mercury, Mercury/Sun, Moon -- with
variations). Different scholars and different texts produce slightly different
mappings. Where there is genuine ambiguity, it is noted.

The Ophite system (reported by Origen from Celsus) and the heresiological
reports of Irenaeus provide the most explicit planet-archon pairings.


A. THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN (Sethian)
   Nag Hammadi Codex II,1; III,1; IV,1; BG 8502,2
   Four extant versions (two short, two long recensions)

   The seven "powers" created by Yaldabaoth, each given a quality, a
   theriomorphic (animal) face, and dominion over a day of the week:

   1. ATHOTH (also Athoth-Harmas in the long recension)
      Quality: Goodness (a corrupted/deficient form)
      Animal face: Sheep
      Planet: Saturn or Moon (placement debated; listed first)
      Day: First day
      Note: The long recension names him "the reaper" and adds an
      alternate name, Harmas.

   2. ELOAIOS (also Eloaiou, Eloai)
      Quality: Forethought/Providence (pronoia -- deficient form)
      Animal face: Donkey
      Planet: Jupiter or Mercury
      Day: Second day
      Note: Name derived from Elohim (Hebrew divine name).

   3. ASTAPHAIOS (also Astraphaio)
      Quality: Divinity (deficient form)
      Animal face: Hyena
      Planet: Venus
      Day: Third day
      Note: Attested on Gnostic gems as associated with Venus.

   4. YAO (also Iao)
      Quality: Lordship
      Animal face: Seven-headed serpent
      Planet: Jupiter or Mars (varies by reconstruction)
      Day: Fourth day
      Note: Name derived from Yahweh/Iao.

   5. SABAOTH
      Quality: Kingdom
      Animal face: Dragon (or serpent)
      Planet: Mars
      Day: Fifth day
      Note: Name from "Yahweh Sabaoth" (Lord of Hosts). In On the
      Origin of the World, Sabaoth uniquely repents and is elevated
      by Sophia to the seventh heaven, making him a complex figure
      who transcends his archonic role.

   6. ADONIN (also Adonaios, Adoneus)
      Quality: Jealousy/Zeal
      Animal face: Ape/Monkey
      Planet: Sun
      Day: Sixth day
      Note: Name from Adonai (Hebrew for "Lord"). Connected to the
      Adonis/Tammuz solar mythology.

   7. SABBATAIOS (also Sabbede, Sabbateon)
      Quality: Understanding (deficient form)
      Animal face: Shining/flaming fire
      Planet: Moon or Saturn (placement debated; listed last)
      Day: Seventh day (Sabbath)
      Note: Name transparently derived from Sabbath. The "face of
      flame" rather than an animal form is unique among the seven.


B. THE OPHITE SYSTEM (reported by Origen, Contra Celsum VI.24-38)
   Source: Celsus's lost work (c. 170s CE), preserved in Origen's refutation
   (c. 248 CE); also partly in Irenaeus, Against Heresies I.30

   The Ophite diagram described by Celsus was a visual map of the cosmos
   used ritually. Origen preserves both the archon identities and the
   ascending-soul formulas. The Ophites used angelic names alongside the
   archonic names.

   Archon (Ophite)    Angel Name     Animal Form     Planet
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   1. Ialdabaoth      Michael        Lion            Saturn
   2. Iao             Suriel         Bull            Jupiter
   3. Sabaoth         --             Dragon/Serpent  Mars
   4. Astaphaios      Raphael        Serpent         Venus
   5. Adonaios        Gabriel        Eagle           Sun
   6. Elaios/Ailoaios --             Dog             Mercury
   7. Horaios/Oraios  Thauthabaoth   Donkey/Ass      Moon
      (also Onoel,
       Thartharaoth)

   Note: The angelic identifications (Michael, Suriel, Raphael, Gabriel)
   are remarkable -- these are the same angels found in Jewish apocalyptic
   literature, here demoted to archonic status. This reflects the Gnostic
   inversion of the Hebrew God and his servants as cosmic tyrants.


C. IRENAEUS'S REPORT (Against Heresies I.30, c. 180 CE)

   Irenaeus lists the seven as: Ialdabaoth, Iao, Sabaoth, Adoneus,
   Eloeus, Oreus (= Horaios), and Astanphaeus (= Astaphaios).

   He states: "The holy Hebdomad is the seven stars which they call
   planets." He does not give explicit one-to-one pairings but the
   order is generally taken to follow the Chaldean descending order:
   Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.


D. ON THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD (Nag Hammadi Codex II,5; XIII,2)

   Lists seven androgynous archons, each with a masculine and a feminine
   name (the feminine name being their "quality"):

   Archon          Feminine Name / Quality
   ----------------------------------------
   1. Yao          Lordship
   2. Sabaoth      Divinity (later repents; elevated by Sophia)
   3. Adonaios     Kingship
   4. Eloaios      Jealousy/Envy
   5. Oraios       Wealth/Riches
   6. Astaphaios   Wisdom (Sophia -- ironic, as it is deficient)
   7. (unnamed)    --

   This text notably describes the creation of the first three archons
   through sound: Yaldabaoth opened his mouth and cooed, and the
   archons responded with the sounds that became their names ("Eee" =
   Yao; "Eh" = Eloai; "Asss" = Astaphaios).

   The text does not assign explicit planetary correspondences, but
   the seven heavens of chaos inhabited by these androgynous beings
   map to the standard planetary scheme.


E. PISTIS SOPHIA (3rd-4th century CE, Codex Askewianus)

   In the Pistis Sophia, the archonic system is more elaborate and less
   clearly mapped to the classical seven planets. Jesus is described as
   having descended and ascended through the archonic realms, binding
   the archons with "mysteries of light" and reversing the motions of
   their spheres.

   The Hellenized form replaces some archon names with personified vices:
   - Authadia (Audacity) = Yaldabaoth
   - Kakia (Vice/Wickedness)
   - Zelos (Jealousy)
   - Phthonos (Envy)
   - Erinnys (Wrath/Fury)
   - Epithymia (Desire) = associated with Venus

   Five archon-leaders are also named: Paraplex, Hekate, Ariouth,
   Typhon, and Iachtanabas, governing realms of punishment.


F. GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS (Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit)
   Nag Hammadi Codex III,2; IV,2

   A Sethian text that describes Sakla (= Yaldabaoth) and Nebruel
   creating twelve angels/archons, rather than seven. The text is more
   focused on the heavenly emanation of Seth and the Five Seals baptismal
   rite than on elaborating archonic planetary correspondences. It shares
   the same cosmological framework as the Apocryphon of John but does
   not provide a detailed seven-archon planetary mapping.


IV. VICES AND QUALITIES IMPOSED ON THE DESCENDING SOUL
-------------------------------------------------------

Across the Gnostic systems, each archonic sphere imparts a layer of
material/psychic conditioning to the soul as it descends into incarnation.
The texts do not always give a consistent or complete vice-per-planet
mapping (unlike the Hermetic system, which is quite explicit). However,
the following patterns emerge from the combined sources:

Planet      Archon(s)              Vice/Conditioning Imposed
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturn      Yaldabaoth/Saklas      Audacity, arrogance, ignorance of
                                   the divine. The outermost shell of
                                   cosmic delusion.

Jupiter     Iao                    False lordship, deceptive authority

Mars        Sabaoth                Wrath, fiery domination
                                   (but note: in OOW, Sabaoth repents)

Sun         Adonaios               Desire for kingship and power

Venus       Astaphaios             Lust, desire (Epithymia in the
                                   Hellenized system)

Mercury     Elaios/Eloaios         Envy, evil machination

Moon        Horaios/Sabbataios     Falsehood, illusion, the lowest
                                   veil before incarnation

NOTE: These vice assignments are reconstructed from multiple texts and
represent a scholarly synthesis. Individual Gnostic communities may have
used different mappings. The Apocryphon of John assigns "qualities"
(goodness, forethought, divinity, lordship, kingdom, jealousy,
understanding) rather than vices per se -- these are presented as
deficient imitations of the true divine attributes of the Pleroma.


V. PASSWORDS AND FORMULAS FOR THE ASCENDING SOUL
--------------------------------------------------

The most complete set of ascending-soul passwords comes from Origen's
Contra Celsum VI.31, preserving the Ophite formulas. Each formula
addresses the archon by name, acknowledges its domain, and asserts
the soul's right of passage through gnosis:

TO IALDABAOTH (Saturn):
"You, O first and seventh, who art born to command with confidence,
you, O Ialdabaoth, who art the rational ruler of a pure mind, and a
perfect work to son and father, bearing the symbol of life in the
character of a type, and opening to the world the gate which you
closed against your kingdom, I pass again in freedom through your
realm. Let grace be with me; O father, let it be with me."

TO IAO (Jupiter):
"You, O second Iao, who shines by night, who art the ruler of the
secret mysteries of son and father, first prince of death, and
portion of the innocent, bearing now my own beard as symbol, I am
ready to pass through your realm, having strengthened him who is
born of you by the living word. Let grace be with me; O father,
let it be with me."

TO SABAOTH (Mars):
"O governor of the fifth realm, powerful Sabaoth, defender of the
law of your creatures, who are liberated by your grace through the
help of a more powerful Pentad, admit me, seeing the faultless symbol
of their art, preserved by the stamp of an image, a body liberated
by a Pentad. Let grace be with me; O father, let it be with me."

TO ASTAPHAEUS (Venus):
"O Astaphaeus, ruler of the third gate, overseer of the first
principle of water, look upon me as one of your initiated, admit me
who am purified with the spirit of a virgin, you who sees the essence
of the world. Let grace be with me; O father, let it be with me."

TO ALOAEUS/ELAIOS (Mercury):
"O Aloaeus, governor of the second gate, let me pass, seeing I bring
to you the symbol of your mother, a grace which is hidden by the
powers of the realms. Let grace be with me; O father, let it be
with me."

TO HORAIOS (Moon):
"You who fearlessly leaped over the rampart of fire, O Horaios, who
obtained the government of the first gate, let me pass, seeing you
behold the symbol of your own power, sculptured on the figure of
the tree of life, and formed after this image, in the likeness of
innocence. Let grace be with me; O father, let it be with me."

NOTE: The numbering of the "gates" in these formulas does not always
match the planetary order as we might expect. This may reflect an
ascending order (Moon = first gate, Saturn = seventh) vs. the
descending Chaldean order, or it may reflect the specific ritual
geography of the Ophite diagram itself.

Additionally, the seal spoken at the beginning of the ascent:
"I have been anointed with the white chrism from the tree of life."


VI. THE HERMETIC COMPARISON: POIMANDRES (Corpus Hermeticum I)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Hermetic ascent described in the Poimandres (1st-3rd century CE) shares
the same seven-planetary structure but differs fundamentally in tone and
theology.

In the Hermetic model, the ascending soul does not face hostile gatekeepers.
Instead, at each zone it surrenders a quality it acquired during descent --
shedding material accretions like removing garments. The zones are morally
neutral or instrumental, not adversarial:

Zone 1 (Moon):     The energy of increase and decrease
Zone 2 (Mercury):  Evil machination / deceitful craft
Zone 3 (Venus):    The illusion of longing / desiderative guile
Zone 4 (Sun):      The ruler's arrogance / display of command
Zone 5 (Mars):     Unholy presumption and daring recklessness
Zone 6 (Jupiter):  The evil impulses that come from wealth
Zone 7 (Saturn):   Entrapping falsehood / the lie that lies in wait

Having shed all seven, the soul rises to the Eighth Sphere (Ogdoad),
"clothed in its proper Power," and then to the divine realm.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM THE GNOSTIC MODEL:
- The Hermetic zones are not ruled by hostile archons but by
  "governors" (kosmokratores) who are ambivalent powers of Harmony.
- No passwords or combat are needed; the soul simply surrenders
  what does not belong to it.
- The Hermetic Demiurge (Nous/Mind) is not evil -- he creates the
  seven governors as part of the divine plan.
- There is no Sophia-fall narrative, no ignorant Demiurge.
- The process is more akin to spiritual purification than escape
  from a prison.
- The Hermetic tradition views the cosmos as fundamentally good
  (though the body may be a hindrance); the Gnostic tradition
  views it as fundamentally a trap.

Despite these differences, the structural parallel is clear: both
systems map the same seven classical planets to a layered cosmos
through which the soul must pass. The Gnostic version darkens what
the Hermetic version treats as neutral or even pedagogical.


VII. SCHOLARLY NOTES AND CAVEATS
---------------------------------

1. PLANETARY ASSIGNMENTS ARE NOT UNIFORM. The Apocryphon of John does
   not explicitly state "Athoth = Saturn" or "Eloaios = Jupiter."
   Scholars reconstruct these mappings based on: the order in which the
   archons are listed, cross-referencing with the Ophite system (which
   is more explicit), the Chaldean planetary order, and the weekday
   associations. Different scholars produce slightly different mappings.

2. VARIANT NAME SPELLINGS are common across Coptic, Greek, and Latin
   transmission: Ialdabaoth/Yaldabaoth, Iao/Yao, Sabaoth, Adonaios/
   Adonin/Adoneus, Eloaios/Elaios/Ailoaios/Eloeus, Astaphaios/
   Astanphaeus/Astraphaeus, Horaios/Oraios/Oreus, Sabbataios/Sabbede.

3. THE OPHITE AND SETHIAN SYSTEMS ARE RELATED BUT NOT IDENTICAL. They
   share most archon names (derived from Hebrew divine names: Yahweh,
   Elohim, Adonai, Sabaoth) but differ in animal forms and the
   specific planetary ordering.

4. VALENTINIAN GNOSTICISM treats the archons differently. They are
   "psychical" (soul-level) powers rather than purely demonic entities.
   The Demiurge in Valentinian thought is ignorant rather than
   malicious, and the archons are subordinate to him rather than
   independent planetary tyrants. Valentinian texts (Ptolemy's Letter
   to Flora, the Gospel of Truth) do not typically enumerate seven
   named archons with animal forms. The planetary structure is assumed
   but not the focus.

5. THE BASILIDEAN SYSTEM (Basilides, c. 120-140 CE) expands the
   archonic hierarchy to 365 heavens under the chief archon Abraxas/
   Abrasax, whose numerical value in Greek equals 365. This system
   transcends the seven-planet model.

6. ON THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD lists only six named archons under
   Yaldabaoth (the seventh is unnamed or Yaldabaoth himself occupies
   the chief position above the six).

7. THE ANIMAL FORMS in the Apocryphon of John (sheep, donkey, hyena,
   seven-headed serpent, dragon, ape, fire) likely draw on Egyptian
   theriomorphic divine imagery and serve to emphasize the bestial,
   sub-divine nature of the archons. The Ophite animal forms (lion,
   bull, serpent, eagle, bear, dog, ass) partly overlap with the
   four living creatures of Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4 (lion, bull,
   eagle, human face), further underscoring the Gnostic inversion
   of orthodox symbolism.

8. THE ROLE OF PROPHETS. In the Ophite system (per Irenaeus), each
   archon inspired specific Hebrew prophets:
   - Ialdabaoth: Moses, Joshua, Amos, Habakkuk
   - Iao: Samuel, Nathan, Jonah, Micah
   - Sabaoth: Elijah, Joel, Zechariah
   - Adonaios: Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel
   - Astaphaios: Esdras, Zephaniah
   - Elaios: Tobias, Haggai
   - Horaios: Michaiah, Nahum

Moon      | Horaios        | Sabbataios     | Flaming fire       | Ass             | Understanding      | Falsehood

IMPORTANT: This table is a synthesis across systems. The Apocryphon of
John's order does not perfectly map onto the Ophite order. The archon
listed first in ApocJohn (Athoth, with a sheep's face) does not appear
in the Ophite system at all -- suggesting that Athoth may be an alternate
name for one of the Ophite archons, or that the Sethian and Ophite
traditions drew on different (though overlapping) archon lists.
