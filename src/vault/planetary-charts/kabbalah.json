  "note": "The ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life with their genuine numbers (1 = Kether through 10 = Malkuth). This is the standard Kabbalistic numbering following the order of emanation: the divine light descends from Kether (Crown) through each successive Sephira to Malkuth (Kingdom). The numbers ascend 1–10 as each Sephira emanates from the one before it. Not compressed into seven planetary levels — the Tree has ten stations, three of which (Kether, Chokmah, Malkuth) have no classical planetary correspondence. Planetary assignments follow the tradition preserved in Cordovero and later codified by the Golden Dawn. Angel correspondences follow standard Kabbalistic attribution. Divine names are those associated with each Sephira in the liturgical and meditative tradition.",
  "correspondences": {
    "Kether — Crown": {
      "number": 1,
      "meaning": "Crown",
      "pillar": "middle",
      "classicalPlanet": null,
      "metal": null,
      "angel": "Metatron",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh",
      "color": "White brilliance",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Crown of the head (skull above the brain)",
      "teaching": "Kether is the first emanation, the dimensionless point from which all existence unfolds. The Zohar calls it the 'concealed of the concealed' (Temira de-Temirin), the aspect of divinity so utterly transcendent that no thought can grasp it. Sefer Yetzirah identifies it with the Breath of the Living God — the first stirring before differentiation begins. Kether stands at the summit of the Middle Pillar, balanced between all opposites because it precedes them. It is not a thing among things but the will-to-be that makes things possible. In Cordovero's Pardes Rimonim, Kether is distinguished from the Ein Sof (the Infinite without attributes) while remaining its most direct expression: the point where the unknowable chooses to become knowable. For the practitioner, Kether represents the highest aspiration — not union with God in the sense of grasping, but the surrender of selfhood that allows divine will to pass through unobstructed. The Zohar teaches that Kether radiates downward through all the Sephiroth like a spring whose waters never cease, sustaining every level of the Tree without diminishment."

    "Chokmah — Wisdom": {
      "number": 2,
      "meaning": "Wisdom",
      "pillar": "right/mercy",
      "classicalPlanet": null,
      "metal": null,
      "angel": "Raziel",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "Yah",
      "color": "Grey",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Right side of the face (right brain)",
      "teaching": "Chokmah is the second Sephira, the first differentiation from the unity of Kether. The Zohar describes it as the primordial point (Nekudah Rishonah) — the initial flash of creative insight before it takes shape. Where Kether is pure will, Chokmah is the first content of that will: the seminal idea of all that will be. It stands atop the Pillar of Mercy, representing the expansive, outpouring force of creation. In the Bahir, Chokmah is identified with the Torah itself in its pre-manifest form — wisdom that existed before the world. Cordovero teaches that Chokmah contains all the Sephiroth below it in potential, the way a seed contains the entire tree. Its relationship to Binah across the Abyss is the primordial masculine-feminine polarity: Chokmah gives the flash, Binah receives and gives it form. The Sefer Yetzirah associates it with the Breath from Breath — the second level of creative articulation. In human spiritual life, Chokmah represents the capacity for genuine insight that arrives before reasoning — the intuitive grasp of a truth that the intellect will later unfold."
    },
    "Binah — Understanding": {
      "number": 3,
      "meaning": "Understanding",
      "pillar": "left/severity",
      "classicalPlanet": "Saturn",
      "metal": "Lead",
      "angel": "Tzaphkiel",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "YHVH Elohim",
      "color": "Black",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Left side of the face (left brain)",
      "teaching": "Binah is the third Sephira and the great mother of form. The Zohar calls her the 'Supernal Mother' (Imma Ila'ah) and the 'Palace' (Heikhal) — the womb in which the undifferentiated seed of Chokmah is received, gestated, and given structure. She completes the Supernal Triad. Her planetary correspondence is Saturn, the oldest and most distant of the classical planets, which in Kabbalistic thought represents boundary, limitation, and the giving of form — not as punishment but as the necessary condition for anything to exist at all. Lead, Saturn's metal, carries this same teaching: heaviness and containment that makes manifestation possible. The Bahir identifies Binah with the letter Heh and with the concept of repentance (Teshuvah) — the return to understanding. Cordovero explains that Binah is where the fifty Gates of Understanding reside, through which all subsequent creation passes. In spiritual practice, Binah is the capacity to take raw insight and give it logical, communicable form. The Zohar teaches that the seven lower Sephiroth are all 'children' born from the union of Chokmah and Binah."

    "Chesed — Mercy": {
      "number": 4,
      "meaning": "Mercy (also Gedulah, Greatness)",
      "pillar": "right/mercy",
      "classicalPlanet": "Jupiter",
      "metal": "Tin",
      "angel": "Tzadkiel",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "El",
      "color": "Blue",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Right arm",
      "teaching": "Chesed is the fourth Sephira and the first below the Abyss that separates the Supernal Triad from the rest of the Tree. It stands at the top of the Pillar of Mercy and represents the unlimited outpouring of divine love, grace, and abundance. The Zohar identifies it with the right arm of God — the arm that embraces. Its planetary correspondence is Jupiter, the great benefic, whose expansiveness mirrors Chesed's boundless generosity. Abraham is its archetypal figure in the tradition: hospitality without condition, kindness without measure. Cordovero teaches that Chesed is the first Sephira to operate in a way that the human mind can begin to comprehend, since the Supernals exceed ordinary cognition. But Chesed unchecked would dissolve all boundaries — love without limit becomes formless. This is why it requires its counterpart Geburah to give its abundance shape and direction. The Sefer Yetzirah associates it with the element of Water in its expansive aspect. In human life, Chesed is the impulse toward generosity, forgiveness, and the desire to give more than is asked. Its danger is enabling; its fulfillment is grace that knows when to stop."

    "Geburah — Severity": {
      "number": 5,
      "meaning": "Severity (also Din, Judgment)",
      "pillar": "left/severity",
      "classicalPlanet": "Mars",
      "metal": "Iron",
      "angel": "Khamael",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "Elohim Gibor",
      "color": "Scarlet red",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Left arm",
      "teaching": "Geburah is the fifth Sephira and the summit of the Pillar of Severity. It represents divine judgment, discipline, and the power to set limits. The Zohar calls it the 'left arm of God' — the arm that pushes away what must be refused. Its planetary correspondence is Mars, and its metal is iron: strength, sharpness, and the willingness to cut. Isaac, who submitted to the binding, is its archetypal figure. The tradition is emphatic that Geburah is not evil — it is the necessary counterpart to Chesed's boundless love. Without judgment, mercy becomes indulgence; without severity, form dissolves. Cordovero writes extensively about the 'sweetening of the Gevurot' — the process by which harsh judgments are tempered through their interaction with the merciful side of the Tree. The Zohar teaches that the origin of evil (the Qliphoth) is not in Geburah itself but in Geburah separated from the Tree, judgment divorced from the context of love. In spiritual practice, Geburah is the capacity for honest self-examination, the courage to say no, and the discipline that makes sustained work possible. Fire that forges rather than destroys."

    "Tiphareth — Beauty": {
      "number": 6,
      "meaning": "Beauty",
      "pillar": "middle",
      "classicalPlanet": "Sun",
      "metal": "Gold",
      "angel": "Michael",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "YHVH Eloah ve-Daath",
      "color": "Yellow (golden)",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Heart (chest center)",
      "teaching": "Tiphareth is the sixth Sephira and the heart of the entire Tree of Life. It occupies the center of the Middle Pillar, balancing Chesed and Geburah, receiving from the Supernals above and transmitting to the lower Sephiroth below. The Zohar identifies it with the 'Holy King' (Malka Kadisha) and with the written Torah — the harmony of all divine attributes in a single integrated expression. Its planetary correspondence is the Sun, and its metal is gold: the radiant center around which everything orbits. Jacob/Israel is its archetypal figure — the one who wrestles and integrates. Cordovero teaches that Tiphareth is the Sephira most accessible to human consciousness in prayer and meditation, because it is the point where transcendence and immanence meet. It is called Beauty not as ornament but as the aesthetic rightness that emerges when opposing forces find their proper proportion. The Zohar's imagery of Tiphareth as the bridegroom to Malkuth's bride expresses the axis that holds the Tree together. In human spiritual life, Tiphareth is compassion — not mere sympathy, but the integration of love and judgment into a response adequate to the situation."
    },
    "Netzach — Victory": {
      "number": 7,
      "meaning": "Victory (also Eternity, Endurance)",
      "pillar": "right/mercy",
      "classicalPlanet": "Venus",
      "metal": "Copper",
      "angel": "Haniel",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "YHVH Tzvaot",
      "color": "Emerald green",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Right leg (right hip)",
      "teaching": "Netzach is the seventh Sephira and represents the endurance of feeling, the force that drives creation forward through desire, passion, and artistic impulse. It stands on the Pillar of Mercy in the lower triad, mirroring Chesed above it. Its planetary correspondence is Venus, the planet of love and beauty in its active, pursuing aspect — not passive reception but the desire that reaches toward its object. Moses is its archetypal figure in some traditions: the one who endured decades of leadership through sheer persistence. The Zohar associates Netzach with the prophetic experience — the capacity to receive divine communication through emotional and imaginative channels rather than intellectual ones. Cordovero distinguishes Netzach from Chesed by noting that Chesed is love in its pure, unlimited form, while Netzach is love as it operates in the practical world — love that must struggle, persist, and overcome obstacles. Its metal, copper, is durable but malleable. In spiritual practice, Netzach governs devotion, creativity, and the emotional stamina required for sustained spiritual work. It is the Sephira most connected to art, music, and ritual — the ways in which feeling carries truth that the intellect alone cannot hold."
    },
    "Hod — Splendor": {
      "number": 8,
      "meaning": "Splendor (also Glory, Majesty)",
      "pillar": "left/severity",
      "classicalPlanet": "Mercury",
      "metal": "Mercury (quicksilver)",
      "angel": "Raphael",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "Elohim Tzvaot",
      "color": "Orange",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Left leg (left hip)",
      "teaching": "Hod is the eighth Sephira and the seat of intellectual precision, analytical thought, and the capacity to articulate truth in language. It stands on the Pillar of Severity in the lower triad, mirroring Geburah above it. Its planetary correspondence is Mercury — swift, precise, and concerned with communication. Aaron, the priestly spokesman, is its archetypal figure: the one who translates the prophet's vision into words the community can hear. The Zohar associates Hod with the splendor of divine speech — the capacity of language to carry meaning across the gap between minds. Where Netzach operates through feeling and image, Hod operates through concept and structure. Cordovero teaches that Hod and Netzach function as a pair, like two legs of a body: feeling without intellect is blind, intellect without feeling is sterile. Mercury, the metal, is liquid and reflective — it takes the shape of its container, as thought takes the shape of the question asked. In spiritual practice, Hod governs study, prayer as spoken word, and the discipline of honest reasoning. It is the Sephira of the scholar and the scribe, and its danger is the substitution of cleverness for wisdom."

    "Yesod — Foundation": {
      "number": 9,
      "meaning": "Foundation",
      "pillar": "middle",
      "classicalPlanet": "Moon",
      "metal": "Silver",
      "angel": "Gabriel",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "Shaddai El Chai",
      "color": "Violet (purple)",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Reproductive organs",
      "teaching": "Yesod is the ninth Sephira and the foundation upon which the entire visible world rests. It occupies the lower position on the Middle Pillar, directly above Malkuth, and serves as the channel through which all the forces of the upper Tree are collected and transmitted into manifestation. The Zohar identifies it with the Tzaddik (the Righteous One) — the figure who stands as a conduit between heaven and earth. Joseph is its archetypal figure: the dreamer whose visions connect the invisible to the visible, and whose righteousness sustains the world. Its planetary correspondence is the Moon, which reflects the light of the Sun (Tiphareth) into the darkness of the material world. Silver, the lunar metal, carries this reflective quality. Cordovero teaches that Yesod gathers and harmonizes all the influences flowing down the Tree, functioning like a prism that focuses scattered light into a single beam. In spiritual practice, Yesod governs the imagination — not as fantasy but as the image-making faculty that bridges abstract truth and concrete experience. It is also the Sephira of dreams, sexuality, and the unconscious patterns that shape waking life."

    "Malkuth — Kingdom": {
      "number": 10,
      "meaning": "Kingdom",
      "pillar": "middle",
      "classicalPlanet": null,
      "metal": null,
      "angel": "Sandalphon",
      "divineNameTetragrammaton": "Adonai ha-Aretz",
      "color": "Citrine, olive, russet, and black (quartered)",
      "bodyCorrespondence": "Feet (soles of the feet)",
      "teaching": "Malkuth is the tenth and final Sephira, the Kingdom where all the forces of emanation arrive and become the tangible world. The Zohar calls her the Shekhinah — the divine presence as it dwells within creation, the bride of Tiphareth, the queen who receives from the king. She is not a lesser Sephira; she is the purpose toward which the entire Tree flows. Without Malkuth, the upper Sephiroth would be like rain that never reaches the ground. The Bahir identifies her with the mouth of God — the place where the divine word becomes audible in the world. She has no classical planet because she is the Earth itself, the arena of action. Cordovero teaches that Malkuth has 'nothing of her own' — she is pure receptivity, reflecting whatever flows into her from above. This is not weakness but the ultimate hospitality: she makes room for everything. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the repair of Malkuth (Tikkun) is the central task of human spiritual life — gathering the scattered sparks of holiness embedded in matter and restoring them to their source. The practitioner encounters Malkuth in every moment of embodied existence: eating, working, walking, touching. All spiritual work begins and ends here."
