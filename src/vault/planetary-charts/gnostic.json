  "note": "Seven hostile planetary rulers — archons — through whose spheres the soul must ascend to return to the divine Pleroma. Unlike the Hermetic ascent (Corpus Hermeticum Poimandres) where the planetary zones are neutral and the soul simply sheds accumulated qualities, the Gnostic archons are active antagonists who imprison humanity in matter and ignorance. The ascending soul must know each archon's secret name and speak the correct formula to pass. Yaldabaoth (Saturn), the chief archon and false creator-god, declared 'I am God and there is no other beside me' — unknowing that the true God exists above him. Planet-archon assignments are most explicit in the Ophite system reported by Celsus/Origen. The Apocryphon of John gives different names and animal forms but does not explicitly assign planets; scholars reconstruct the mapping from listing order. Where sources disagree, both versions are noted.",

      "description": "Chief archon and Demiurge — the ignorant creator who fashioned the material world from the spark of Sophia's fallen light. Lion-faced in the Ophite system, reflecting ferocity and claim to kingship. Created the other six archons from his own substance. His declaration of sole divinity is the signature act of Gnostic cosmology: cosmic ignorance masquerading as supreme authority."

      "description": "The second archon bears a version of the supreme divine name, recast as a subordinate power. The seven-headed serpent combines threat and false wisdom. Donkey-face in the Apocryphon may connect to Set/Typhon — the ass-headed Egyptian chaos god. Jupiter's sphere: false kingship and corrupted law."

      "description": "Rules Venus's sphere — desire perverted into possession, beauty twisted into sorcery. Ass-face (Ophite) and hyena-face (ApJohn) suggest stubborn appetite and scavenging greed. In On the Origin of the World, appears in masculine-feminine pair with Sophia Zoe, reflecting Venus's dual nature."

Name derives from Adonai, one of the most sacred Hebrew divine names, reframed as planetary prison-warden. Dragon form connects to Tiamat and the chaos-serpent. Lust here is not merely sexual but the consuming appetite of the ego for experience."

      "description": "Rules Mercury's sphere — language, writing, intellect perverted into deception. Eagle-face suggests sharp-eyed predation — the mind as hunter rather than servant of truth. Mercury's traditional messenger role becomes, in the archontic sphere, the messenger of lies. Gnosis passes through by wielding true knowledge against false."

      "description": "Rules Mars's sphere — raw violence and competitive rage. Bear or dog face (Ophite) suggests bestial fury; ape face (ApJohn) suggests mimicry without understanding — violence as imitation of divine power. The ascending soul must pass through wrath without being consumed by it."

      "description": "Occupies the Moon's sphere — boundary between archontic heavens and the material world. Bull face connects to lunar crescent and archaic lunar cult. Uniquely among the archons, in On the Origin of the World Sabaoth repents, recognizes the superior light of Pistis Sophia, and is elevated above the others to a throne in the seventh heaven. This redemption narrative is found for no other archon — Sabaoth alone turns."
