The text itself assigns no metals, no planets, and no sephirotic correspondences — those layers arrive later through Kabbalah, alchemy, and astrology. What Genesis gives is simpler and stranger: seven acts of divine speech, a cosmos spoken into being, and rest as the culmination rather than an afterthought.",
