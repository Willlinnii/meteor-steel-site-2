        "description": "The world's oldest known bilingual dictionaries, listing thousands of Sumerian words with their Eblaite (Semitic) equivalents. These tablets prove that systematic translation between languages was practiced four thousand years ago and provide invaluable evidence for the oldest known Semitic language, which is closely related to later Hebrew and Aramaic."

        "description": "Thousands of tablets documenting the economic operations of a city-state that controlled trade routes across the ancient Near East. The archives record textile production, metal transactions, agricultural yields, and diplomatic gifts — revealing that Ebla was a commercial powerhouse trading with Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley four millennia ago."

They demonstrate that international law and diplomacy were already sophisticated practices in the third millennium BCE, predating the famous Hittite-Egyptian treaty by over a thousand years."

These texts document the religious practices of a Semitic people centuries before the cultures of the Hebrew Bible, providing crucial context for understanding the deep roots of Near Eastern religion."

These documents reveal the sacred dimension of kingship in the earliest Semitic civilization, where the ruler served as intermediary between the gods and the people — a concept that would shape Israelite and later Western theories of sacred kingship."

Some of the place names — including possible early references to cities later known from the Bible — generated enormous scholarly excitement when first published, though many identifications remain debated."

Though fragmentary, these texts demonstrate that northern Syria had a rich literary culture contemporary with — and independent of — Mesopotamia's, challenging the assumption that all ancient Near Eastern culture radiated from Sumer."

These records reveal that Ebla exported high-quality textiles to Egypt and Mesopotamia, generating the wealth that made the city a major power. The archive documents thousands of workers, mostly women, employed in textile production."
