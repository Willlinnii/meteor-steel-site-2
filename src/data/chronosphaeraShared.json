  "introduction": "The exploration of the Seven Deadly Sins weaves through the rich tapestries of theology, literature, and art, drawing from the insights of ancient theologians like Saint John Cassian and Saint Thomas Aquinas, who laid the foundational perspectives on these moral vices and their virtuous counterparts. The sin-virtue dichotomy is further illuminated in the allegorical narratives of medieval and Renaissance literature, from the moral trials of 'The Faerie Queene' by Edmund Spenser to the symbolic journey through sin and redemption in Dante's 'Inferno.' Artists like Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and Salvador Dalí have visually captured the essence of these sins, each through their unique lenses, transforming them into profound reflections on human nature and morality.",
  "thoughts": [
    "There are a range of classic artistic depictions of each deadly sin by major artists like Bosch, Dali and Blake; as well as a set of major classic stories that depict each character and narrative.",
    "One of my good friends and a teacher who used to work for me produced the movie Seven. She would be an amazing choice for interviews.",
    "Shazam and The Devils Advocate also offer depictions of the seven deadly sins in the movies.",
    "Sin has become seen as impurity—as something we should not have. The seven deadly sins represent that which we must not be. Yet, we are. When we repress and disidentify with any part of ourselves, we move it to the shadows of our consciousness. In this way, the seven deadly sins can be seen as the seven deadly shadows.",
    "The way we have demonized the seven deadly sins has ensured that they are pushed into the unconscious of our society, where they can really do damage.",
    "Why is it that so many of our most pure spiritual leaders do such shadowy things? When we decide we are pure, we disidentify with whatever we think of as impurities. The 'pure' spiritual leader is not pure, they have only purified their identification such that their sin becomes shadow.",
    "A look at the 7 Deadly Sins provides an opportunity to explore both the healing and oppressive sides of mythology.",
    "A look at the deadly sins is an opportunity to look at comparable sets of spiritual rules or guidelines around the world.",
    "Energy Flow - Sets of virtues and vices can be found all over the world and throughout its spiritual philosophies.",
    "In eastern traditions, the Six Arishadvargas and the 5 Hindrances overlap with the 7 deadly sins and correspond with blockages of energy in the body.",
    "From purity to balance - What is Sin? Is it impurity? Should we have none of them? The art, stories and theology tends to be more about guiding us towards a more profound spiritual existence by encouraging us to not let these sins rule us.",
    "From a feminist perspective, the way lust and greed have been used often result in the demonization of women.",
    "Shadow Splitting - The righteous person is at risk of disidentifying with their sins. This is unhealthy.",
    "Guilt fear control - The 7 Deadly Sins serve as 7 Deadly Boogie monsters for our inner desires.",
    "The 7 deadly sins do not only exist in a set. Each of the 7 has a life of its own.",
    "Attachment is to the eastern traditions what gluttony is to the west. In China, those who have failed this moral test become 'hungry ghosts.'",
    "The sins and their virtues constellate archetypal qualities that are often personified.",
    "The series will end up using mostly the same core sources for each episode.",
    "7 is a number to deconstruct infinitely, but first and foremost it is the 7 lights in the sky that are not stars.",
    "7 notes on a musical scale, these are the 7 discords.",
    "7 is the virgin number, because no numeral can be divided by or into 7.",
    "Artists like Dali worked on the seven deadly sins as a spiritual journey."
