Arthur’s rise in arrival is like the birth and arrival of the sun, and his rise to prominence is like the suns rise to noon.

Both are born of fathers taking of both are born of divine figures who take the form of a mortal father they fake being the father of the bride the husband of a certain queen and this is how they come in this world this is the same exact detail I know of no other major heroes like this besides what we can see a little bit with Seigfried we see the same motif of it’s Siegfried who pretends to be the father and then the other king comes in and impregnates the woman."

Where the rebel attacks the tyrant’s order, the trickster speaks truth to power and pokes at pride. To the trickster, order and power are always a joke. So as a representative of order and power, even if he’s the best representative, Arthur draws satire.\n\nArthur may be the best personification of order bringing but he is still a representative of order, which will always be the target of jokesters, prankster‘s and trickster figures. There will always be a dichotomy between tyrants and rebels serious people and tricksters, this is timeless. This is the tension between disruption and stability. This is a crucial tension that must always exist. We must always be pursuing stability and we always be challenging its order."

          "text": "The entire grail quest can be seen as a hypermasculine quest for the feminine\n\nThe Arthurian material is like the dream material of a psyche that is repressing the feminine on one level but on a deeper level knows it’s a problem. And this is why we see the patriarchal power structure associated with a wasteland at a loss for vitality and a quest for a grail that repdresents femininity. It’s also why it presents an order fragile to the feminine disruption of Guinevere, their Eve figure.\n\nThe Arthurian consciousness is expressed as both repressing the feminine and in quest for it. Morgana represents the repressed feminine vitality. The wasteland of Arthurian legend represents the wasteland we get when we represss feminine vitality. The sun of Guinevere represents the shadow disruption of the feminine when it’s repressed. And the Grail quest represents our recognition that the splitting off and repression of feminine consciousness has created Ed a wateland that can only be redeemed by the integration of what we’ve split off and repressed, which is the feminine LF and so the quest for the Grail, which represents, at least on one level, the womb, is the quest for the integration of femininity and all that it represents. This also becomes a story aboutnloveniver war, which we see recurr in the convergence of pacific at and feminist movements from Athens to modern day."

          "question": "Is it probable that King Arthur was a Roman military leader?",
          "text": "The fall of Camelot echoes the fall of both Eden and Rome, which built and abandoned Britania. This created a power vacuum and triggered invasion. But though the military was withdrawn, mercenaries, who had been paid in land, didn’t want to leave. And so, as the story goes, a Roman commander, Artorius, stayed behind. And with the help of these soldiers, he defended Londinium—a contender for Camelot.\n\nPart of why this story is so compelling is because the soldiers he led were a strange group of foreigners who jousted on horseback in heavy armor and told the story of a king, who, like Arthur, when he died, demanded his sword be cast into water; and as with Arthur, his attendant faked it, and like Arthur, the figure  insisted until, finally, the meteor sword, a sword from stone, was thrown in the sea.\n\nThe myth of King Arthur has assembled itself from pieces of history and myth, for which reason the disqualification of any sources based on their lack of certain elements is kind of a joke, to put it kindly. Tolkien was less kind. His point about Arthur is that storytellers draw from what he called a Cauldron of Stories. This was a poetic expression of the imagination. Do our dreams not mix life with legend? Myths are no different. The quest for a linear or reductive comparison is a symptom of our own hypermasculine Western consciousness. What we should really be asking is what was in the water. All of it was. Celtic, Christian, Caucasian and Classical myths, legends and historical figures—all of it. It is exactly the repetitions of history and legend that result in a myth like Arthur’s."

          "text": "Fact or fiction,Monmouth didn’t just articulate a lineage of kings in doing so,, he created a story of Britain,\n\nMonmouth’s Historia mimes the founding myth of Rome. Where the Aeneid tells the story of how the first Roman king came from Troy, Monmouth tells the same story. Brutus, brother of Aeneas, appears as the first king. Did Monmouth make it up, or does this take us back to a memory of a mythic concept that had been introduced by Romans at a time they were still trying to bring citizens of Londinium to identify with Rome? Either way, the narrative presented by Monmouth creates continuity between the Classical world and Britain before presenting an ideal king in which we see major historical memories and essential mythological textures.\n\nMore than a state myth for England, the Arthurian material represents an integration of material thst the imagination and cultural spirit had been trying to integrate everywhere — Christian, Classical, Celtic, Caucasian.and the integration was happening at a time when the populations had been integrating for the common cause of the Crusades, which also informed the stories. It even seems likely that much of the material came from cathars, templar  and other sects that were themselves transnational."

          "question": "Evolution of the myth: How did the myth become the version as which we know him today?",
          "text": "The Myth of Arthur has assembled itself from countless sources—historical and mythic. And as it has, though it’s grown further from any kind of historical truth, it’s only become more resonant. Our hearts are the target towards which it has repreatedly adjusted its aim.\n\nMost Arthurian scholars are focused on the tension between Celtic or Norse pagan mythology‘s meeting Christian mythology‘s in the Arthurian Saugus, but this leaves out to essential streams one is pagan pagan classical Roman mythology and the other is Caucasian mythology that was imported by Roman mercenary as he turned on Rome retain power after the fall of Rome and then ended up defining the aesthetic that we know is the medieval era, this is heavy armor on horseback jousting towers ladies with handkerchiefs and pants as opposed to Togus.\n\nWhere we see the clear evidence of the classical mythology isn’t just in the Hercules figures that are pulled out of the ground and displayed in museums all throughout England, but also in Geoffrey of Monmouth story that introduces Arthur on such a major level, first British king is presented as Brutus, who comes from Troy, and Baron AnnaGrace the story of Rome in the classical world into the mythology of England. And then we see a directly in the figure of Arthur, whose birth is exactly like Hercules where the divine father pretends to be the known mortal father or husband of the wife of the mother. Both stories very unique and both of them visit the gold island of golden apples this is where Hercules goes the island of Sunset the golden apples on his golden cup boat and this is also where Arthur goes at the end of his life where he’s after the battle of Baden where he and Mordred mortally wounded one another. And of course where the grail is associated with immortal life in the Arthurian saga, the cup of heavy is the symbol of the mortality for the classical mythology’s, and it’s Hercules he marries he be upon his death in this represents is achievement of the mortality.\n\nFALL OR ROME AND RISE OF ARTHUR CONTINUED – When Rome began collapsing and pulled out of Britain after having been there for centuries,  while the legions left, many soldiers and mercenaries had been paid in lands thst were now in a power vacuum. What seems to have happened is the rise of a Roman commander who led those who were left behind. His key skill was rallying support, and his historical connection to the round table may have been in relation to the round amphitheaters in which support was rallied around the message of a common cause. The heart of Roman London, Londinium, persists to this day. And among those who rallied in defense of the formerly Roman occupied England were former mercenaries from the Caucasus and North of the Black Sea, and it seems thst this is where the Arthurian material got its aesthetic\n\nENGLAND’S CAULDRON OF STORIES – Imagine you’re an English family before Caesar jnvades, then he conquers England and loses supposedly his sword after seekng Whiskey heal Scottish wounds and calling it the elixir of life. Then, in come Clasical myths, like thst of Hercules, whose statues fill British museums and who, like Arthur, was born of a father pretending to be someone else, and, who like Arthur, goes to the island of golden apples, where the sun sets, and where Arthur is associated with the Grail, Hercules immortality is symbolized by his marriage to Hebe, the divine cup bearer, who gives him Nectar. Then, everyone in the Roman Empire, including England, converts to Christianity, which offers  eternal life as an elixir  in a chalice. The Roman empire then loses the ability to defend England and withdraws, by which time they’ve brought in mercenaries who tell stories about truth telling vessels, swords made of meteor stone thrown in lakes when kings die and heavily armored men on horseback thst have been seen jousting in front of ladies in towers since 1200 BC. So imagine this cauldron of consciousness that’s taken all this in. The Arthur myth is a mix of everything—the whiskey Caesar called  aqua vitae and the nectar of hebe and tbe  blood of Christ and the truth telling vessel AND the Celtic cauldron of Dagda — they’re all there in the Arthurian material. And then that material is there in Aragorn and the silver cup Bilbo retrieves. The material just keeps alchemizing and evolving. And what it’s always evolving towards is the moving reflection of our own psyches.\n\nFRENCH: With Lancelot and his family we see the French more clearly represented in the story. Here we see an association of the French man with a lover — even a scandalous one — that persists to this day.\n\nThe Mayan throne was a mat on which the culture’s myth was woven, and into this myth was woven the entirety of their culture.\n\nThis is a perfect metaphor for the Arthurian throne. His myth is one that weaves together the threads of Europe—Classical, Celtic, Caucasian, Christian, Anglo, German, French, Welsh. We can work to pick apart it’s sources, but it’s successful resonance with so many people depends on the successful blending of so many identities.\n\nHERCULES: The birth of England’s greatest hero is a near exact match for the birth of Rome’s—Hercules. In both cases they are fathered by the ultimate patriarch—Zeus and Uther--who take the form of the mother’s husband.\n\nARTHUR & THE ARK: Like Arthur, the Ark is destined to return again, and like Arthur, the Ark’s coming and going can be associated with the sun, which it emulates as a golden vessel in which the god travels. This can be seen in the golden cup boat of the sun in which Hercules travels and in the gold plated boats that led the Egyptian sunrise ritual for what must have seemed like aeons. The golden rod can be associated with the golden line or the golden path of the sun, which we also see in the yellow brick road or the yellow arrows on the Camino de Santiago. In the golden chalice we recognize the golden cup boat of the sun that Hercules rode from sunrise to sunset, from which he retrieved a golden apple that also shined like the shn. The ark itself, the golden vesse in which the sun journeyed, would also have been well known. From the chariot of the sun to the cupboat of Hercules and the solar prow of Osiris — time and again we  see the sun associated with a golden vessel in which the sun travels.  In Tennysons take, Arthur arrives as a baby in a basket, like Moses."

          "text": "Flight 19 plays into the patterns of major myths that serve major functions. For example, the Chumash tell a story of seven boys who turned to geese and were never seen again—the winter migration of these birds represents the flight of souls to an afterlife. This is one of the key mythic patterns that underlies flight 19 – it’s the story of our boys whose death and flight are the same. Don’t we all want to believe they passed into another world?\n\nThe loss of a rescue team while searching for a lost boy has appeared in Naval myths before. Hercules, for example, is lost to the Argonauts when searching for a lost boy and fellow shipmate.\n\nYou might say it became a myth as it permeated countless cultural mediums—from pulp magazines like Argosy to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But it’s not the existence in multiple mediums that make a story a myth, it’s the presence of the story in conversation that supports its multimedia incarnations…which reinforce its presence in the conversation."

One version is that Joseph of Arimathea hosted the last supper, caught Jesus’ blood in its cup, then carried it to Glastonbury (in England). Another version is that Peter carried it from Israel to Rome and sent it to Spain for safety. Another version is that the Templars found or were given the Grail upon their arrival in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the conflation of the Grail from Arthurian legend with the Holy Cup was a later development; and some of the stories are that the Grail was Cathar Treasure or a vessel used during Pagan rites transformed for Christianity. And the pagan theories deepen, as several scholars associate the grail with earlier images like the Classical cup of Hebe or Celtic Cauldron of Dagda. Then there are the arguments that it isn’t a grail, it’s a stone—the philosopher’s stone—which turns the grail into a sort of symbol for enlightenment. Grail, stone, maybe it’s just a metaphor? Maybe it’s a womb—the womb of Jesus wife and/or any womb. Maybe it’s a meteorite? Maybe it’s all about the mythopoeic imagery of any and all cups? Maybe we should look at holy vessels in older traditions? I’d like to connect it with the crescent moon and thumbnail associated with the resurrection of Inanna. The theories are endless.\n\nWhy did the Nazis look for the Holy Grail?Heinrich Himmler very much believed in the Occult, which didn’t just mean that he believed objects like the grail could help him win the war, it also meant that he wanted to create a mythic reality. He didn’t just want the grail, he wanted an order of Nazi Knights. At the same time, the grail is like Excalibur in that it carries a sort of implicit right to rule, which, as seen in Nazi mythology, was an obsession of Himmler’s.\n\nWhen you think about the Nazi pursuit of the grail, you have to think about it in the context of the intended extermination of the Jews. This would have been the extermination of the “chosen” race, which would have made way for their notion of the master race."

This is the same pursuit that drove alchemists towards the philosopher’s stone. The outer journey is but a projection of the inner quest. I think this is also why we read these stories.\n\nRelics are endowed with meaning such that the possessor of that relic becomes the possessor of that meaning.

This energy comes with love and wisdom, it heals individuals and whole lands, brings life, restores sanity, delivers food, is endlessly full of wine and can the bearer with god. And in that it represents divine power, it’s not subject to natural law. This means it can float, disappear, and endlessly refill.\n\nAs a cornucopia, the grail represents the endless refilling of both Earth and Mother with offspring and new life. The way wine endlessly refills the grail or cup of shared by Baucis & Philemon can be seen in the monthly refilling of the maternal vessel with the life-giving blood of menstruation.\n\nAs a portal to the divine, when Gallahad finds the grail, he transcends immediately—leaving th eworld behind.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH – Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote the first great work about Arthur, didn’t write about the grail. In the Vita Merlini, however, he wrote about apples that made knights go mad and an elixir that restored their clarity. This is reminiscent of berzerker warriors whose battle-related madness must be quenched by waters. Perhaps the greatest power of the Grail Myths was the way they helped to heal Crusade induced PTSD. These are stories that follow the arc of a closed heart that opens and a wasteland that’s redeemed – of warriors who stop fighting and lovers who start loving.\n\nWhy is it not so absurd to look for references to the Holy Grail in Eschenbach's Parzival?Wolfram would have had every opportunity to pick up stories and encounter interesting figures. There’s no reason to believe that some of the stories that filtered to him weren’t based in truth. And for those who believe the Templars retrieved the grail as opposed to Joseph of Arimathea or Saint Peter; Wolfram’s story, in which the grail is protected by Templars, could offer clues. At the same time, many believe that Wolfram is more likely to have encoded a recipe for the philosopher’s stone than the grail, which he described as a stone. This would mean that the grail isn’t found, it’s made, and Wolfram’s story could be the recipe.\n\nas is so often the case with conspiracy theories, there is often a glimmer of truth in it. –\n\nTolkien’s notion that the imagination of a storyteller is like a Cauldron of Stories is meant as a response to academics who want to flatten stories into limited if not singular inspirations. As he sees it, stories are ladeled from an indivisible soup of myth, history, rumor and life—dreams, thoughts, you name it. So truth? Tale? There’s always some kinda both."

          "text": "We have older cups that were less significant to less people, so if Jesus was a historical figure, which is the consensus among academics, then it is entirely plausible. The story that the catholic church could have taken responsibility is plausible, the story that it was retrieved from Jerusalem by the Templars is plausible, and I don’t think it’s impossible that a wealthy man who buried Jesus could have fled to England with the prized possession. So though I’m more compelled by symbolic interests, I wouldn’t dismiss the literal possibility. Core to the Christian tradition is the notion that something perfectly symbolic—like Christ—could also be very real.\n\nGRAIL AS MYSTICAL UNION – I thought I had it yesterday, the sun was rising and my mind was empty, but alas, just out of reach. Some day though, someday, I’ll feel one again—one with myself again, one with my world, maybe even one with the divine. And then, no matter where I’ve journeyed, I’ll have the grail—I’ll be the grail.\n\nLOVE: I’ve got to say, the deeper and wider you go, the more you come to recognize that the core common denominator is love—love heals mind, body and soul as well as crops and even belligerence. Love is the elixir we drink—it’s the gate we walk through to find union with self, with cosmos, and even with the divine. Love is what makes the womb the womb. If there’s an incarnation of Jesus in the form of a child, the point is that it’s an incarnation of the wisdom of love on earth. In many ways, the grail stories are in opposition to the testosterone-colored violence and persecution of their day. In some ways you might say that these stories represent the real Christianity of the time – not the kill to save model. These stories deconstruct the violence and prioritize the inner journey. Parzival, for example, climaxes when Fierfitz and Parzival stop fighting! So when you go to Roslyn, and when you stand under the stone they say you have to stand under to be able to see the grail, you’ve got to realize the grail is you, and your capacity to heal, create, unify and find wisdom—through love, the true heart of Christianity."

          "question": "Where in art history do we find the Holy Grail and can it give us clues to its location?",
          "text": "In the medieval period is was the standard practice of Alchemists to encode their recipes in mythic imagery to avoid watchful eyes. Many of the artists who worked with alchemists to represent this imagery also worked on the imagery of the Tarot. That artists of the time were capable of encoding hidden meaning in their art is beyond question. And we know the primary secrets they were encoding concerned the process of creating the philosopher’s stone and elixir of life, which share qualities and are conflated with the Holy Grail – especially in the context of Wolfram’s Grail Stone and his alchemical penname. So definitely artists and storytellers were encoding the recipe for the philosopher’s stone in quest-like myths; as can be seen in the story of Nicholas Flammel; and I’m sure that if these artists thought they knew where the grail was, they could write encoded stories and paint encoded pictures that pointed, in a hidden language, to the grail. That they encoded a path to the philosopher’s stone, I’m definitely sure that kind of thing was going on, and that it was really about a recipe process. That they encoded a literal path to a literal grail? I couldn’t make a definitive claim about that.\n\nEspecially when you know that in old Spanish the word \"grial\" meant a mortar-shaped drinking vessel. So it makes sense that the path to the Holy Grail leads to Spain. ”\n\nOne of the interesting things about the Mortar and Pestle in the context of the Holy Grail is that it unifies the image of wine and bread insofar as flour is ground in the pestle, which becomes a vessel for the wine. Christians already associate the flagellation of Christ with the threshing of grain, and so for those who see the grail as a mortar, they can see the grinding of the grain as symbolic of a direction towards death followed by wine, which is symbolic of life.\n\nCan the Essenes (where Jesus is supposed to have celebrated the last supper) really existed?Just beyond the reach of what we can really be sure about are these reasons to believe John, the Baptist of Jesus, and Joseph of Arimathea, in whose tomb Jesus was buried—were Essenes. This has led to the belief that Jesus had a particularly close relationship with the Essenes, who many believe hosted the Last Supper. The reason this is disputed by academics is because the Essenes did not pursue wealth and were not known as urban; which makes the idea of an Urban Last Supper with the Essenes seem unlikely. The response of believers comes in the form of Josephus’ 1st Century description of an Essene area and gateway in Jerusalem, which may have been found in recent years.\n\nWhat could the Grail mean in Parzival?The Grail in Wolfram is a stone brought down from the heavens by Neutral angels—like a meteorite, from which the first iron objects were made—including swords. If the Grail Stone relates to a meteorite, then meteorites are the common denominator between the Grail and Exaclibur, an iron sword that bestows a heavenly right to rule. This can also be seen in the vajra or lightning stone of Indra, which parallels Zues’ symbol of authority.\n\nWolfram is a word for Tungsten, which is harder than steel, more resistant to fracture than diamond, and has the highest melting point for a pure metal. Such mythopoeic mortality is certainly resonant with the philosopher’s stone if not the Holy Grail. It’s also true that Tungsten was often the crucial impurity in Damascus Steel – which made it lighter, harder, stronger and sharper.\n\nMythopoeically, if you think about a hero that’s stronger and sharper in a way that relates to their corruption, you get to anti-heroes, the earliest of which, I believe, were personifications of steel. For ages, metallurgy and religion was focused on purification. The discovery of steel, however, was the discovery of the strongest most immortal of metals that came with a bit of corruption. This is what we see in the earliest Personifications or Men of Steel like Sosruquo and Achilles. Not only are they stronger and more invincible than anyone else, they also corrupt the laws of god.\n\nHow realistic is it that a mug survives 2,000 years and then ends up in Spain?We certainly have older and less important cups, so there’s no reason to consider it out of the question. And though authenticity is almost impossible to confirm, to what extent are Christians hoping to drink from the real grail, and to what extent would a surrogate cup support the ritual participation of practitioners?\n\nAs the story goes, Saint Peter took the cup from Jerusalem to Rome, where he founded the Catholic Church and used it to perform Mass. Nearly 300 years later, it was carried from Rome to Spain when Emperor Valerian demanded all Christian relics when he persecuted the religion. This is when it was given to Saint Lawrence, who gave it to Proselius, who is believed to have delivered it to Spain. It then pinged around several churches and hermit caves before, in 1135, it was exchanged, with documentation. A paper record then follows the grail until the Spanish civil war, when it was hidden from Communists.\n\nVerifications of the Spanish grail include its stone composition, which is believed to have concerned Kosher laws, and its consistency with the Catholic narrative of Peter retaining the grail. It also fits the description of Saint Jerome. That having been said, the Catholic Church has long been suspicious of its Authenticity, though that did not stop both of the last two popes from using it for a Mass."

          "text": "Ritual: That early Arthurian references aren’t to Christ’s cup has almost become irrelevant in that the tradition that carries in our world and imaginations is one of the Christian ritual.\n\nChristian Mass: The most important ritual in Christianity is the Mass, which centers around the cup of wine, which provides a path to spiritual immortality—like the Holy Grail; so whether or not there’s a literal link, to our imagination, these holy vessels are resonant, mimetic and easily conflatable.\n\nPagan Grail – One of the popular theories of the grail is that the tradition emerges from the relationship of Christianity with more ancient mystery religions throughout the mediterranean. These traditions typically revolve around some kind of death/resurrection and immortality deity, like Dionysus, Mithras, Attis, Adonis, Persephone, Osiris, Inanna—and sometimes many are seen as one. In the oldest real megamyth we have, Inanna is brought back from death on a cross from bread and elixir of life—contained within the lunar thumbnail. Dionysos is the god of wine, with which we toast the living. Blood, elixirs and vessels are central to many of these cults, and we even have some wild ritual vessels from Eleusis, where wine came from much more than grapes. So as Christianity displaced the Pagan religion, it is believed that many of these mystery traditions and their ritualistic cults came to assimilate the myth in their own ways. Some of these sound pretty wild to us – Orgies in the name of Christ, the drinking of menstrual blood and semen as the elixir and bread of life, and even the consumption of aborted embryos. Could these cults have contributed to grail legends? Could grails pertain to ritual vessels that predate the conversion of Pagan cults? Most of these were traditions were wiped out by crusades and inquisitions, and myths tend to get written down when things are ending – like Genesis, which is believed to have been written around the time of Israel’s fall to Babylon. Could some of these cults have avoided complete annihilation? This is one of the places where the bottom drops out into mystery."

          "text": "The very essence of the Christian religion depends on its literal truth – that Jesus was real and the son of God. Yet, it was the Muslims who had Mohammad’s sword and other real relics. This is why some believe that the European interest in relics was in response to their collision with Islam. At the same time, the Christian emphasis on literal truth has sent them down multiple hyper-literal paths. Lutheran literalism in response to Enlightenment science was a later incarnation. Earlier was the fixation on relics.\n\nA relic, first of all, is a connection to a source—to the Buddha, to Mohammad, to Christ—and that connection is valuable because of their connection with the divine. The relic is then seen as a sort of connection with the divine. And this is how we feel about the objects of lost loved ones – they connect us with them. The grail is, in this way, the ultimate relic – not only is it an object that connects with someone connected with the divine, this is seen as the actual object that makes the connection. The grail is the source of wine-blood that delivers salvation and immortality. It is the ultimate relic that offers an ultimate connection with the divine.\n\nWhat other goblets are there that are thought to be the Holy Grail?Not only are there multiple “Holy Grails,” (The Nanteos Cup, Antioch Chalice, Sacro Catino, the cup of Lake Chiemsee and others) There are also countless divine vessels from other religions. Some of these are even likely to have influenced the Grail – from the cup of Hebe to the Cauldron of Dagda."

Single coned speakers, for example, produce a single wave in which we hear countless individual instruments . In the pursuit of oneness, elixir is the ultimate mythopoeic image.

In theory, it would have been stone. This is consistent with Wolfram’s description of the grail as a stone. It’s also consistent with the description of the grail as a mortar, which also would have been stone. The same can be said of the meteor.\n\nWhy is the Holy Grail a constant theme in films and novels (Dan Brown, Indiana Jones)?On one level the grail quest is just an incredible narrative structure – an ultimate mcguffin, you might say. It also represents that thing that saves the day  -- that thing that renews the world. This can be the life and light that returns after winter or the antidote delivered at the end of ____ Name your movie. What story matters more than the story of retrieving and delivering the essence of life?\n\nThe common denominator between Robert Langdon and Indiana Jones is Joseph Campbell, the famed mythologist who led real grail tours and had a major influence on Dan Brown, George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg. You even see Grail motifs identified by Campbell in the most recent Star Wars films—a projectile through the eye of the red armored knight and entering into the forest where there’s no path. The grail quest can also be seen in the journey of Bilbo, who steals a silver cup from the dragon before discovering a stone that carries a right to rule.\n\nIf Dan Brown's theory is correct and the Holy Grail stands for Maria Magdalena, who was married to Jesus, what would this knowledge mean for the Catholic Church?It’s not just that the Catholic Church wouldn’t want to be in conflict with the authority of Jesus’ own family, which they already face with the Eastern Church and its Patriarch, James, brother of Jesus. More importantly, the Catholic church should be afraid of a path towards the divine that they don’t control. The path to the heart through the journey of romantic love is in competition with the path to god they promote. (Though it seems that could be changing.)"

Together with the French explorer Thierry Jamin we enter in the most important Inca foundation before the colonization. Under the church of Santo Domingo, we find the ruins of Coricancha, the Temple of the Sun of the Inca civilization. A Temple dedicated to the most important god, Inti. Entire rooms, even courtyards, that were covered here with gold by the Incas. The greed for wealth led the conquistadores to bloody plundering of such places. Tons of Gold was melted down by the Conquistadors within a month of the sacking of Cusco, most of which was sent back to Spain, some forever lost at the bottom of the Atlantic due to Spain’s Naval battles with their rivals. But it could be that the most important and spectacular of these treasures were in fact hidden by the Incas, carried away through Cusco’s underground labyrinth of secret tunnels to the city of Paititi. Paititi is the native name of the \"Lost City of the Incas\", the mysterious refuge of the Incas in eastern Peru. An inaccessible place somewhere along the rainforest with the rich possessions of the Inca ruling caste. All the clues of the Paititi legend reveal clear parallels to the European myth of El Dorado. Together with other experts, Thierry Jamin wants to bring light into the darkness and follows the traces of the ritual signs of the natives."

These are now one of the most important sights from the Inca era and are located on the outskirts of Cusco. In fact, researchers have discovered a gigantic tunnel system under the city. Various chroniclers leave data about secret labyrinths, the so-called “Chinkanas” of the Incas. There is a theory that there is one of them that would be connected to the Coricancha, the ancient Golden Temple of Cusco. Thierry Jamin explores one of the tunnels that are still accessible. Here he finds evidence that people must have performed ceremonies, but El Dorado must be much further away."

Thierry Jamin and his team set out from Cusco on an expedition into the depths of the jungle. After more than twenty expeditions, this one will be the most important expedition of his life. Thierry travels with his team over five days by jeep, on foot, on the boat and on helicopter to reach the square mountain. His search is reminiscent of one of the many expeditions of the conquistadors. Thierry recognizes structures of an unknown site from the helicopter, but they cannot land on the heavily overgrown mountain.

According to the legend, the Muisca covered the new king with gold dust, crowns, bracelets and precious stones in a kind of coronation ceremony. This treasure was then taken on a raft to the middle of Lake Guatavita. At this point, the gold was thrown into the murky depths of the lake as an offering to the gods. The belief that the lagoon was full of gold because of the offerings led many colonisers, starting with the Spanish, to try to empty the water from the lagoon.

          "text": "El Dorado was a man who covered himself from head to toe in gold—an unforgettable sight that spread through the South American imagination like a viral tweet, but by the time it got to the Spanish, el dorado was a city of gold. .\n\nThis is often in the mythic structure of a ruler. And so we talk about Washington, or Paris, like a character in the news. Washington did this Berlin did that. El Dorado did this, El Dorado did that. This is the personification of a culture in the form of its ruler. And rulers often and as was the case in the city associated with El Dorado, rulers often personify the sun as well. In the sun itself is only a incarnation of something greater, of light. Of the source of creation in existence. So the king is the master of all of the gold and all of that power and light and vitality from which existence comes. And the health of the king and then be associated with the health of the land, as a scene in the story of Oedipus Rex in Athens. The sun going down into the water is symbolized by the man or the golden objects going down into the water. These are common rituals for kings, the reason what was Arthur his sword must go back into the water upon his death, a motif ancient for Indo Europeans. As found in the Caucasus mountains with the figure of Patras. This is a symbol of the kings death or the kings entry into the other world. Osiris on the solar boat, every night, went into the underworld, the Dewert. This was the journey of the sun, but also the journey of the role he played as king. All over the world, leaders can be priest or spiritual leaders. Whether it’s the Dalai Lama or the caliphate. These spiritual divine leaders like a Cyrus sore Horace in Egypt are associated with knowledge of the other world, like shamans. They adventure from the known world to the other world of death, knights, chaos, and the source of creation. They journey into the land of dreams and healing, for the we not all heal from our dreams. And so the king, El Dorado, with spiritual leader ship as well as political, convenes across the boundaries of above and below like the golden sun, entering the sea, descending beneath the waves."

          "question": "How strong is the myth of El Dorado?",
          "text": "With people looking for El Dorado, it wasn’t long before El Dorado’s started spring up all over the map!\n\nJourney to Source\n\nEl dorado as the great city not just of gold but a sort of ultimate source within the Americas, something holy, maybe terrifying to a Christian,\n\nAs far as we know the oldest city with great Piramidal ruins in the Americas is in Peru which is also where we find Cusco the city associated with El Dorado. The search for El Dorado is a search for the source of all the gold they see in South America, the search for chorus is a search for the truth or original source of culture from which everything they see comes\n\nThe fountain is a movie that demonstrates the spiritual she’d metaphorical nature of the road to el dorado. In the film, we see high Jackmans characters find el dorado as he finds a cure for death and spiritual answers at the center of reality, symbolized by a World tree or world navel from which he drinks the elixir of life. While the search for el dorado may have been for gold, it was motivated on a deeper level by something Existential and even spiritual, a sort of search for the meaning of life.\n\nThe search for El Dorado is a search for some ultimate origin of all the goals. This is a search for the origin of all the vitality, all the light, with which the goal is associated. This is a search for the golden city of Apollo. Which the sunset was associated. This is a search for origins. And it’s only through a mind thinking in economic terms that we fixate on the economic value of the goals in this equation. And I think the conquistadors were themselves fixated on the economic value of gold. This is a myth of individuals pursuing great wealth coming into the European consciousness in a major way.\n\nLike the grail quest in its journey to center\n\nJourney to Destination: Golden Road & Treasure\n\nHeroic conquistadors journeyed across the western ocean to western lands for golden treasure, like Hercules, who crossed the western ocean for golden apples and Coyote, who swam from from north of Los Angeles to the Channel Islands for a golden flower. This is a recurring motif — the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, only the rainbow would be better understood as the yellow brick road or the yellow arrows that point the way from anywhere in Europe to its western most point in Santiago. If we want to really get down to it, in the depths of the imagination, the golden road is the road of the sun, which sets in the west, where, culture after culture, imagines treasure.\n\nBefore the road to el dorado was the Camino de Santiago, which is directed by golden arrows. These arrows point to the western most tip of Europe, Santiago, where the sun sets on the continent. The golden road is the road off the sun. And it continues in the Americas. And like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the imagination imagines a golden city at the end of the golden road.\n\nOr the emerald city for Dorothy on her yellow brick Road? Is it an extension of the Camino DeSantiago with its yellow arrows pointing the way of the sun? Is it the journey Hercules takes across the western ocean to the western islands to find the golden apples? Are the journey of lizard and coyote from Southern California across the western ocean to get to the western islands retrieve the golden flower? When we look into the myths that have already outlined this quest to El Dorado we see the journey of the sun, we see journeys into death, we see searches for the origin of creation, and we see searches for self. The road to El Dorado is all of these. It is the journey to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nAn ego myth with a shadow of deveststion\n\nUnfortunately, the hero’s journey or what jung would call individuation is a journey highlighted by disillusionment and ego death. In the case of the conqueistadors, those who went in search for el dorado all failed, and they all suffered that loss. Along the way, great damage was done.\n\nFor every conquistador it would’ve been different. And, like Jungian individuation or the hero’s journey, It’s a journey of ego death and Disillusionment. No conquistador found what they were looking for. These are journeys of defeated pride.\n\nThink about the inflation of Christian’s when encountering less powerful people who  worshipped them upon arrival—the entitlement.\n\nHero’s Journey and El Dorado\n\nGreat adventure myth — from home on a holy quest ti bring civilization and to come back with glory and riches.\n\nOverview: The road Del Dorado is a classic hero journey in that you leave from home as a representative of your cultures status quo as enforcer of it even. And then you depart for some great adventure crossing some great ocean to get to some foreign land where everything is completely different and nothing is like what you expected. And at first you would be completely overwhelmed, but then you would learn how things work there a little bit how to move in that jungle. But then you would Fail to find what you thought you would find which shatters the ego and one’s expectations and one’s sense of control over their reality. And then this moment the hero complex should die. Disillusionment should set in. And having not gotten what you thought you wanted you should find what you really need. Or if you are the bad guy in the story, you keep wanting it anyway, you can’t let go, you keep driving for it, at the expense of lives, love, care, and any consideration for others. And in the story of El Dorado you can be sure that there were heroes and villains and everything in between. Certainly victims, many many victims. Whatever roll the conquistador played, the completion of the journey will be there return home, to deliver whatever they found it cold or wisdom, as the new person they become. And you can be sure that no conquistador return from the Americas the same person who left.\n\nLike any heroic figure on a journey, they set out from a familiar world to find themselves in a landscape beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nThe world from which the Conquistadors set out was one of tyrannical oppression that was becoming more and more about monetary wealth as European capitalism began to bud.\n\nIn the imagination of a conquistador, finding the treasure of El Dorado was like an Arthurian knight finding the grail. It was an ultimate quest."

The Human condition established by Adam and Prometheus is one of estrangement and separation—from god, from humans, from everything. And if you see everything as atoms, if you can’t see anything but as separate, it’s even worse! Like Adam, we experience separation as lonliness. Our isolation is an source of existential dread. And this dread sets up a desire—a desire for union, a desire for oneness or wholeness or whatever you want to call it, and this motivation is behind our love for stories about union, which tend to be journeys to some divine source—from the grail quest to a search for the Ark, this is a search for divinity that’s motivated by a feeling of estrangement."

It’s thus no surprise that it was exactly the spark that was associated with God.\n\nWhen Benjamin Franklin attatched a key to a kite and brought the power of lightning down to earth in the form of electricity, he may have enacted the same miracle as the Ark, which, is repeatedly associated with lightning and is said to have created sparks between the wings of its cherubim. As Prometheus stole fire from the gods, the stories of Moses and Benjamin Franklin brought the power of heaven down to earth.\n\nLightning belonged to Yahweh, Zeus, Indra – alongside the meteorite, it is the supreme power from above.\n\nTo bring the light of heaven to earth has been repeatedly associated with divine authority. Where the Ark represents divine power on earth, its descriptions look like those of lightning and meteor stones, both of which bring heavenly light down to earth.

For the Jews, this was the time leading up to and into the Babylonian exile. Not only do stories seem to get increasingly historical as they approach this period in their record, it’s also the exact time during which the Ark went missing. So while the breastplate of Adam might seem like a more mythic artifact, there’s a temptation to see the ark as a historic one.\n\nOn the other hand, the loss of a connection with God was thematically consistent with other popular stories during the time of their exile, especially the story of Eden.\n\nMost mythological traditions recognize a time before time, which is typically delineated by a flood--from the epic of Gilgamesh to the Chumash narratives of Southern California. And as we move forward in history from the flood, the stories tend to get increasingly historical. This is especially the case with myths set in the same time they were written down. When oral tradition is under threat, there tends to be a shift towards writing things down.

Though they both carry incredibly ancient material, the focus on writing them down seems to have been in response to the Temple’s destruction and the Babylonian exile; so whether or not the story of the Ark is historically true, it expresses true historic experience.\n\nWhen Constantine shifted Rome to Christianity he didn’t just move the capitol to Constantinople, he physically moved the pillar at Delphi, which was known as the center of the world where the God, Apollo, spoke.\n\nGods are associated with locations, but when you’re leaving to go somewhere new, God would have to be taken with you. It’s not just that the Ark serves as a seat for God, it also served as a transport. This is a fire theft.\n\nARK, GRAIL & HERCULES: We might compare the Ark with the golden cup boat of Herakles thst he rides from sunrise to sunset, where he retrieves a golden apple towards the end of his mortal journey, which culminates in his marriage to Hebe, cupbearer of the gods, who gives him Nectar or divine nourishment. This divine nourishment in the divine cup can be associated with the manna in the golden bowl within the ark. Similarly, we can compare the ark itself with the golden cupboat lent to Hercules by the sun god. Like the Ark, this is a golden vessel in which the god travels, like the ark, it’s associated with a golden cup filled with divine nourishment. One of the darkest connections can be seen in the cloak that kills Hercules like a blanket with small pox and the tumors with which the Ark smote its enemies. Both could be memories of biological warfare.\n\nIf we look for the potential presence of the Kabeiroi somewhere near the roots of philosophical history, we find them in Miletus – the storied birthplace of philosophy. Sandra Blakely recounts the story:\n\nThe king of Assessos was murdered by his brother, and his children, fearing for their lives, fled to neighboring Miletos. Their murderous uncle pursued, with the army of Assessos, and laid siege to the town. The people prayed for relief, and were told that help would come from Phrygia. This help appeared the next day in the form of two young men, Tottes and Onnes, who appeared out of Phrygia, bearing a kiste, a basket, between them that they carried with two poles; inside were the sacra of the Kabeiroi. They promised to save the town from its aggressors, if the\n\npeople would establish the rites of the gods. The city council accepted the cult, and the next day the two youths led the army out to battle behind the sacred kiste. The sight of the sacred container struck the attacking army with fear and panic, and they fled, eventually to join the Milesians in celebration of these gods. Pausanias (I.4) and Aristides (Panegyrikos 2.469) note the Kabeiroi were the most ancient gods of Pergamon, another coastal Asia Minor city. Their ethnicity remains fluid: they may be Phrygians, and share their names with the Kabeuric mountains of Phrygia; Philo of Byblos makes them the sons of Phoenician Sydyk, part of a large family of culture heroes who invent writing, magic, prophecy, and metals, celebrated alongside Poseidon in Beiruit. (17)\n\nThe Phoenicians and Phrygians both spread the Kabeiric cult, and by sea and land they sandwiched Miletus. The first philosopher was “Phoenician by ultimate descent” (Herodotus, Histories I.170) and a resident in a city that had adopted the Kabeiroi cult.71 Whether or not the “first philosopher” identified with the mysteries, it seems likely that, as a Phoenician and Milesian, he was familiar with what the Kabeiroi were about.72\n\nOne might see the Ark as an Old Testament predecessor to both Christ and the Holy Grail—this was the vessel through which of the Divine Word\n\nOne might see the Ark and Commandments as a predecessor to Eve and Christ — these are the divine word and the vessels through which they are delivered. And where the Ark is described as a seat or throne for god, it was made on the journey from Egypt, where the seat or throne was personified by Isis and the lap on which her son, the once and future king, was seated. This is to say, Mary, like the Ark, was the seat of the divine word. The Old Testament or the old word is represented by those tablets and the stories thst, according to folklore, were also written by Moses. The New Testament or new word is that logos delivered by Christ.\n\nWhen Gilgamesh finally crosses the western sea, and when he finally reaches untapishtim, the lone survivor of the flood and sole human to achieve immortality, he asks him for the secret of eternal life. His answer is a weed beneath at the bottom of the sea, which represents the wellspring of life that emerges from the bottom of bottoms like the first sliver of moon or the new light that starts coming at midnight or the winter solstice or when a baby first sparks. This is imagined as coming from the source of creation itself, which is somehow magically located both within the womb and within the earth. This source is imagined almost as a portal through which the divine can enter, not unlike a mother from which the divine child emerges. The source through which the divine enters the world often becomes associated with the center from which the world emerges—from Eden to Delphi. One of the center of the world in folklore is in the temple, and over that center say a stone on which written the name of god, and what this stone does is hold back, like a stopper, the Tehom, the subterranean waters of creation. This is comparable to nu, the Egyptian waters of chaos and creation.\n\nWhen Gilgamesh asks for the secret of eternal life, the clue is that immortality has only been attained by the one who turned his house into a boat, into an ark—and so the Ark of the covenant is not just the seat of god on earth, it’s a moving throne. And it is only because the Ark can travel that, according to legend, it’s survived. The same can be said of Judaism itself, and in a way, it’s the Ark that builds thst capacity into their myths. When Semites moved to Egypt they began worshiping and identifying with Egyptian gods, in part because deities were understood to be local, but when the semites leave Egypt with Moses, their god is presented as having a home thst moves—he is a traveling god. From the nomadic tent in which it lived to the Churches still shaped like upside down Arks, the Abrahamic home of God is meant to evoke this traveling quality, which seems to be integral to its dispersion and global success. One would have to wonder if this goes back to older memories of the pastoral semites who had long been travelers. On the other hand, Jehovah is associated with the storm, and we tend to associate the writing of the commandments with lightning. Storm gods can be traveling gods and in Egypt, Seth, the storm god associated with the Semites, was a traveling foreigner.\n\nThunder stones from atop mountains are capable of discharging a zap. One might wonder if these thunder stones inspired the lightning stone of Indra or the ark of the covenant, which was also said to have carried a stone on which gods name was written. In another story from the Caucasus on which the face of a child appears in a stone, this heavenly stone was actually a meteorite.\n\nStones were taken from the dry sea bed where the ark crossed, and when you start thinking about heavenly stones and a dry sea floor, you start thinking about the heavenly stones that could dry a sea floor—meteorites, which might also be associated with the tablets, stones with messages from the heavens.\n\nWhen Moses found the Israelites worshipping Egyptian deities, one of the problems was that Egyptian deities were located in Egypt, which suggests that the worshiping of Egyptian deities was representative of a hesitation to leave and/or a kind of looking back to Egypt — like the wife of Lot. To establish a deity thst travels may have solved this problem.\n\nThe secret journey of Osiris through the underworld on a solar prow seems to have informed the Ark, which looks much like aker, a scene from the bottom of the Egyptian underworld where the spark of the divine first comes into this world, a scene in which an altar thst contains the god is surrounded by either two chimera or two birds, both of which seem to inform the winged cherubim.\n\nOsiris journeys in a solar boat thst lights the nations, and at the crucial moment of this journey he is represented in an altar or within a vessel that’s surrounded by two chimera in the book of the dead and two birds in the myth.\n\nKilled thousands who looked at the grail — weapon of mass destruction — like the object the Kabeiroi used.\n\nHeavenly Burden on shoulders like thst on Atlas back\n\nExodus 25:22–god speaks from between the cherubim on the mercy seat literally as though that is the location.\n\nIn revelations, when the Temple is opened and the ark appears there, it’s highlighted by flashes of lightning and the quaking of earth.\n\nDavid dances when the ark comes into the holy city\n\nThe ark is a common artifact between Moses and David, the Merlin and Arthur of Jewish mythology, and like the Grail or Excalibur, it represents the divine mandate of the monarchy.\n\nOnly the true of heart can see or touch the Holly of Hollis, which can also be said of the Grail\n\nraised their eyes and saw the ark and were glad to see it. The cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stood there where there was a large stone; and they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the LORD. When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day. These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron; and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages The large stone on which they set the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.\n\nIt is the stone that witnesses the Ark in the field\n\nThe ark killed Phillies by giving them tumors, which reveals it as a biological weapon of mass destruction. This would be consistent with the Egyptian players from which the ark emerges.  One might even wonder if the historical reason Jewish soldiers were warned not to take treaties is because they were contaminated. Certainly the ark is a container that is itself contained within s as container. And David didn’t want it in his city after he saw it kill Uzzah\n\nIron was included in what the lord claimed in phillisykne\n\nThe ark associated with the search for a resting place as though it’s a divining Rod or as though the meteor it’s pointing the way to a divine location.\n\nThe ark is the covenant that makes the Jews a “light to the nations”\n\nIt is also the carrier of the stones of the divine testimony\n\nArk of god carried the divine testimony and represented the covenant that anointed its barers as a light to the nations.\n\nAll carried by oxen like a plow,\n\nWhen the ark arrives in Samuel the earth resounds\n\nIn numbers it’s covered by a porpoise skin and a blue cloth —\n\nThe rod of Arron is budding like the staff of Joseph of Arimathea —\n\nUzzah was shocked at the threshing floor. The threshing floor is where the wheat and chaff are separated, which, in the Abrahamic tradition, among others, represents the separation of soul from body. In this way it’s not unlike the scene when Galahad finally sees the grail and immediately leaves his body behind for heaven.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the fact that the Ark is wrapped in porpoise skin is thst the porpoise was associated with Dionysus, whose father annihilates any mortal thst sees him directly. The porpoise was also associated with Delphi, from which we get the name Dolphin. Like Delphi, the Ark represents the seat of god.\n\nThe manna in the ark represents divine nourishing energy — as the seed can be found in the chaff, the manna can be found in the ark — these are both images of divine essence within a vessel, not unlike a hod in a temple, boat or casket. Notice Israel is itself feminine, a vessel from which come the sons of Israel.\n\nLevites carry the Ark, which is stored in a tent — funny that the first levinjeans were made of tents and they are the vessels for the true divine sparks — us.\n\nThe veiling of a woman and of the ark is in common — this veil is as a door, a covering that seals their portal to the divine. The veiling of the ark is like the clothing of eve or the veiling of a bride — this is the sealing of the divine door to paradise and creation that is the woman’s womb.\n\nThe ark is gold inside and out — it’s shell and it’s contents. It’s also what makes the Jews a light among nations, and it is often leading the way. These are motifs associated with the sun.\n\nThe golden jar filled with the essence of divine nourishment is an incredible forerunner to the a holy grail and the Brad body of Christ\n\nThe wood is acacia, which is the tree into which Osiris’ coffin boat grows and from which he emerges. I’m this way the acacia was seen as a vessel or trunk or ark of the god known to semites leaving Egypt. It might also be. It’s that it was in the are of the Holy Land where Osiris was imagined as having been inside this acacia wood\n\nThe golden jar in which the manna was stored may be even more of a condensed image of the holy grail than the ark itself.\n\nLike Mary and the Grail, on the other side of the Ark is the divine.\n\nWhy would there be commonalities between classical mythology and Judaism? Not only were both part of a larger Mediterranean culture and it’s melting pot of mythologies, they also share a common parent — the Phoenicians, from which both get their alphabets. Phoenicians were teachers to both the Greeks and the Jews, for whom they built the temple and provided the dye for the prodigal sons mantle.\n\nFrom Egypt to Greece the ancient view of the world included a recognition of sunrise over the Caucasus and sunset past Gibraltar, or the pillars of Hercules. At the bottom of this image was Egypt. And so when we see Solar objects and figures like the ark or prodigal soon come from Egypt, we are seeing an enactment of the solar journey. Egypt was associated with the bottom, and so we see the ark as a symbol of a American coming out of Egypt like the sun coming out of the underworld. The Egyptians would have sent the sun as going under them and their earth between sunset and sunrise and as Moses and the ark emerge shining in the east, they bring a new day just like the sun, and the river they cross, while it’s the Red Sea, it’s also oceans, the World encircling ocean on the other side of which are the divine lands from which the sun rises.\n\nThis goes back to a historic period that saw the ancient powers like Egypt and Babylon begin taking a back seat to Indo European empires like Persia, Greece and Rome. This is also the time we saw the Hebrews enter the historical record.\n\nPriests of the ark of the covenant are like the company on the solarnprow carrying Osiris\n\nSometimes the ark is accompanied by a cloud representing God, pointing back to his storm god qualities, which we see in the lightning also associated with the tablets and the power of lightning that the ark Carrie’s\n\nWhen Jeremiah prophesizes thst there will be a time thst the ark is not needed, because the people will have righteousness in their own hearts, it sets up the Christian understanding of the messianic age in which we have access to the Joly spirit and divine morality thst doesn’t require an intermediating priest.\n\nThe ark is called the strength and glory of god, and it precedes him, which is not unlike the aegis, the symbol of Zeus’ power thst preceded him. Both are vessels. Both seem to have some association with the sun.\n\nPalestine is the center of the world, Jerusalem the center of Palestine, the Temple the center of Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies the center of the Temple, the Ark the center of the Holy of Holies; and in front of the Ark was a stone called the foundation stone of the word.\n\nIn some versions the ark carried the unspeakable name of God\n\nLevi of the cart lance of the cart\n\nLike the Grail the ark brought abundance. When it appears in the temple, the golden trees fill with fruit\n\nVessel—recepticle for the law\n\nFolklore of sparks coming from between the cherubim which connects it further with aker. This spark kills snakes and scorpions while the sweet smoke that comes therefrom is associated with the redemption of the world\n\nCandle placed before it every sunrise and sunset connecting it with the sun it seems\n\nIn the folklore it was taken back to heaven and then returned to humans by angels with the stone pieces which is a set up for three story of the grail in which it’s called a stone brought down from heaven by neutral angels\n\nIn one version there is a cat figure in the ark that might be seen as nepthys, the feline deity Osiris had sex with and who is associated with aker.\n\nThe ark belonged to Seth who shared a name with the Egyptian Seth with whom the Semites identified when entering Egypt. Seth was the one at the front of the solar prow like the ark at the front of the Jewish company\n\nAccording to an Islamic legend the rod of Aaron like the sword of Arthur rests in the bottom of a body of water, and like Arthur, it’s said it will return\n\nJews weren’t big on images or icons that represented god and have continued to move away from them.\n\nGold rings with a pole going through looks like the Egyptian died pillar which is thematically similar in that it represents a bridge or connection between this world and the divine. It’s also associated with acacia like the ark, and like the ark, the Acadia of Egypt was associated with the traveling   seat of god, in their case Osiris. This pillar to heaven might make us think of the pillar of fire associated with the ark.\n\nFor the ark to be a lightbulb it would need to exist in a vacuum\n\nJets of flame shot from it in the folklore, sun\n\nLike Christ, the ark was associated with the ability to forgive sins—especially on the collective level. This annual forgiveness of sins is not uncommon among new year rituals around the world\n\nThe pillar of smoke and fire may have found some inspiration in the volcano, one of which may have even been visible in the distance during the Jewish exodus from Egypt."

          "question": "Our main question is of course „Could the myth be true?“  or better „Could the lost tribes possibly exist until today?“",
          "text": "Historic roots in Israel\n\nThe first part of our research leads us to ruins in Israel that proof: yes, the so-called „Kingdom of Israel“ or „Northern Kingdom“ - which is supposed to be the union of 10 tribes -  did exist. And yes: it was conquered by the Assyrians. The „Kingdom of Judah“ (= the remaining 2 tribes Judah & Benjamin) was not touched by the Assyrians as they kept on paying their tributes. Our conclusion: the basic story of what Bible / Old Testament / Thora tell is based on true events. There was a divide between the Judaists and a great part of them vanished in the 8th century BC.\n\nNumerous cases all over the world\n\nProf. Shalva Weil an Anthropologist from Jerusalem collects all the stories from the different possible tribes. Even though two of them have been officially recognised by Israel’s main Rabbi - until today there’s still no proof. We tell the example of the „Falashim“ or better „Beta Israel“- a jewish minority in Ethiopia. Since the 1970s they have been persecuted by different regimes so the state of Israel declared them to be descendants of the „Tribe of Dan“ and evacuated great numbers in the 80s and 90s. Calling them a „Lost Tribe“ just made things easier and was a smart move by the chief rabbi - but won’t serve as proof for the whole Tribe Story. The example also shows how closely connected religious and political questions are in Israel: being Jewish officially also means having the right to live in Israel / becoming an Israeli citizen.\n\nThe Lemba people\n\nOur main case for trying to proof the story are the „Lemba“, a people living in northern South Africa and Zimbabwe. French Anthropologist Dr. Edith Bruder travels there. She meets a young man who wants to become the Lemba’s first rabbi, now that he knows that their own beliefs match with Jewish Religion. In general the Lemba just follow the rules of their ancestors without connecting their rituals and beliefs to religion at all. Today many Lemba are Christian, Messianic Jews or whatever… but they all avoid pork, circumcise their sons, are endogamic, slaughter their animals the same way jews did thousand of years ago. Dr. Bruder visits one of their Shabbats and experiences: it’s nothing like a normal Jewish shabbat. She then focusses on finding information about their own oral traditions. On a Lemba Cemetery she experiences that they bury their dead facing north - as this is where they believe to come from. In their oral tradition - there are no written sources - the name of their „home“ is Senna. Years ago, British researcher Dr. Parfitt claims to have found this place in today’s Yemen.\n\nDNA samples show that some of the Lemba men - to be precise their priests called the „Bouba-Clan“ - seem to have more genetic parallels with people from Yemen than with surrounding African people. Another comparison between Bouba-Clan-members and Jewish people called „Cohen“ - which are descendants of the Jewish priests called „Cohanim“ - in 1999 indicates a high possibility they share a relatively high percentage of DNA. A follow-up study in 2013 puts numbers in question. With a German DNA specialist from Mac Planck Institute in Leipzig, we try to find out how reliable DNA tests are at all. A short experiment with up to three people shows - yes - it is possible to find out about your ancestors just by analysing your DNA. BUT the usual time frame for this won’t go back 3000 years. The set up of the 1999 test seems questionable to the expert but it still shows a high possibility for the Lemba to have roots in Arabia.\n\nWith regards to their rituals, their oral history and the DNA results, the anthropologists conclude that the Lemba might very likely be descendants from Judaic people. They are the best guess for a Lost Tribe - but it will probably never be possible to proof the myth at all.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Ten-Lost-Tribes-of-Israel\n\nLonger newspaper article:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/us/dna-backs-a-tribe-s-tradition-of-early-descent-from-the-jews.html\n\n1999 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1288118/\n\n2013 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259153827_Lemba_origins_revisited_Tracing_the_ancestry_of_Y_chromosomes_in_South_African_and_Zimbabwean_Lemba\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\nQuestions Will Linn:"

Which would evidenced by Proof that the myth is true. This becomes even more powerful when the detail you want to prove concerns that thread that connects you and your people to the greater narrative, which is the case for many African Jews.\n\nThe prophets connect the returning of all Jews to Jerusalem with the coming of the Messiah - so it becomes a very important part of their faith.

This has to do with why Judaism, Christianity and Islam are so focused on the historicity and literal truth in their stories. Historical accuracy is an essential part of the religion."

If they are, they are entitled to a state sponsored visit and right to return. This would mean the entire group, if elevated to Lost Tribe Status by the chief rabbi, could immigrate to Israel.\n\nIt’s a strong link between religious and political matters. By allowing or even inviting all Jews (to be precise: people with at least one Jewish grandparent) to return to Israel it means: when you are Jewish - you can become an Israeli citizen. And who could be more Jewish than a descendent of the legendary tribes? That way a whole group of people could immigrate to Israel - if the chief rabbi officially gives them „lost tribe“ status."

Before it was found, we thought Troy was just a myth Could this be happening with the Lost Tribes of Israel?\n\nJews expect a historicity to their myths, because their myths are their histories. This turns scientific investigation—like DNA testing—into religious investigation. So in the case of African Jews, DNA evidence becomes proof that their myth is historical, that they are part of the story, and that they, too, are chosen people.\n\nThe Jewish understanding of history as a living out of god’s plan gives religious significance to the historical validation of their mythic memories.\n\nIn Judaism, their histories are their religious narratives. History is the unfolding of God’s plan. And because of this, proof that their narratives are historically accurate becomes proof that their mythic memories are real."

All we have to do is get over the delusional myth that ancient humans weren’t highly interconnected, and we’ll see that their journey is not beyond reason.\n\nIn the case of Africa’s coast along the Indian Ocean, the coast of Africa is just an extension from the coast of India and the Arabian peninsula, so despite the fact that we tend to be blinded by a crazy myth that our world was disconnected, trade was far more integrated in the ancient world than most of us realize, including in this area, which is represented by era after era of cultural exchange."

But what’s more: the facts completely cover what the Lemba tell: that they left the Arabian Peninsula, they seem too have Arabian clan-names, the boat, the second Sena in Africa - it’s just too many details for this to be a simple legend.\n\nWhat is the Mythic function –\n\nHow many Jews today around the world can trace their lineage all the way back to Israel the lost tribes is a myth for them it is a myth that points those with no comprehending understanding of how they connect back to Israel back to Israel if they are Jews. It is a myth or story that contains the desire to return and the desire to invite and the desire to make something new when that returning happens and that’s what the state of Israel is doing right now inviting juice all over the world even if they don’t know how they traced back to Israel to return to their population in their home world."

This personal memory and experience of separation becomes colored by religious narratives that cast such departures as tragedy while calling for return. We see it in the exile from Eden and desire to return. We see it in the Babylonian exile. We see it in the story of lost tribes. And we see the traumatic displacement from home become core to Jewish histories yet again when they were exiled from Spain, and again when they were taken to Concentration camps. This deep trauma of separation and the desire to return is more than historical. As we see in the story of Adam and Eve, it is a repetition of their experience of separation from god. To be in Eden was to be with God. To be in Israel before the temple was destroyed was to be where god was. To be forced from the Garden was to be forced from God, which was to be alone in the world."

The disagreement is over whether or not the Jews arrived in Palestine to displace the canaanites, or if they were a local group. On a much larger level, however, we have to recognize that The Phoenicians, who were the immediate neighbors of the Jews, came out on top when the world collapsed. In fact, the Phoenicians built the Hebrew temple. So what we have to realize is that this significantly affected migration patterns and economic realities in their neighborhood. So for me, the conclusion that Jews are just a runaway converted group of Palestinians is too simple. If you try to reconcile the historical and mythological account, you get the idea that at least some of the Palestinians who made up the Jewish community were Allies of the Phoenicians from the time of the Bronze Age collapse."

This sabbath day was associated with Lost Tribes. The last day of the Roman week was also dedicated to the father god, Saturn, from whom we get the scycle wielding figure that we know as Death. This is to say, the rest of the sabbath is like the rest we’re talking about when we lay someone down to rest. So when we see the association of the lost tribes with the sabbath, and with a dry, still, lifeless river, we recognize the suggestion that these tribes are truly gone – maybe killed, maybe assimilated.\n\nwhich is a more poetic way of saying they’re dead, for what really is the sabbath? The day of rest? For the Romans, this was the day of Saturn, the father god of time who, like the reeper, carries a scythe and personifies death. To be on the other side of the sabbath, on the other side of Saturn, the other side of the last day of creation, is to be beyond the realm of death.\n\nLost Tribes of Israel\n\nPeople were a lot more connected than we think\n\nThe Jewish identity is likely older than Judaism.

If we go further and then conflate the scenes, which are both located at sunrise, on the world’s tallest mountain we find Eden in Khazaria, in the Caucasus, on Elbruz, the tallest mountain in the world from which the Greeks and Egyptians saw their sun rise, the mountain to which Prometheus is bound. Mythically, they are the same locations – the location at which the human condition is established—thus the common elements of human clay, mortality, suffering and labor.[1]\n\nThe imagination paves a clear road. We can see the mythic bridges from Eden to Khazaria. Are there literal ones? Could the original vision of Eden have come from Elbruz? Beyond question—it is harder to argue that it did not than that it did. When Genesis was written, Hebrew sailors shared the Mediterranean with Greeks and Egyptians, who saw the eastern edge over which their sun rose as the Caucasus mountain range. Written descriptions of Prometheus on Elbruz would have been roughly contemporary with Genesis. Unless the Hebrews had perfect earmuffs when engaging the larger world they shared, they located the sunrise and world’s tallest mountain in the same place as the other sailors with which they shared the Mediterranean. This is to say, the association of Elbruz with Eden would not have just been boosted by Christianity leading up to the time of the Khazars, it would have been in there from the beginning. Still, the connection is only in the imagination. Without a doubt, this connection in the imagination would have been significant. Did the British Royals really descend from Brutus from Troy, or is this just a fantasy maintained by the British imagination? Print the legend.\n\nThe question remains, however, could there have been a real and literal hereditary connection of the Khazar royalty with Hebrews in Israel? If Eden is the first homeland, how did Jews get to Israel? There are multiple answers covering multiple time periods, but the most recent time period of major significance was that of the Bronze Age Collapse, which is when the Hebrews first appear in written history. They appear among Sea Peoples in a raid on Egypt. Shortly after this period of Sea People raids, the population of Palestine exploded and converged to Judaism. We know that many of the Sea Peoples did indeed come from the Black Sea, where we find the Caucasus. If any of the founding tribes of Israel were from the Black Sea, if they were from the Black Sea themselves or if they settled with allies from the region, we can find a literal link and historical moment when Black Sea peoples came to Israel. This would explain why Greeks do not say they are from their sunrise mountain, but Hebrews do. It would also explain the ancient Hebrew familiarity with leading centers of iron work in the Black Sea. Genesis was written 600 years after this time. The Khazars emerged 1800 years after this time. If there was a memory of their ancient connection, could its final gossamer have been maintained by a Royal lineage? Could it have faded into legend? Would the legends have died?\n\nSEMITES – In the Akkadian empire, all the Semites were united under a single rule. Jews, today, recognize themselves as descended from Shem, and as the story goes, the Muslims are descended from Ishmael, but in truth, Jews are not the only Semites. The genetic story of the Jews suggests that they are a fraction of the semites.\n\nAccording to myth, Jews are descended from Abraham, who descends from Shem. Shem is the father of the Semites. His half-brother, Ishmael, is remembered as father of the Muslims. Genetically, however,\n\n[1] Mythologically, it is easy to understand how we can reproject the myths of home onto the landscapes of a new home. The myths associated with the mountain where you were become associated with the mountain where you arrive. When we do this, there aren’t always perfect fits, and these imperfect fits can point us back to the origins of our myths. For example, Eden is supposedly the tallest mountain in the world, and it was located at the place from which the sun rose. From Sumer to Israel, there are no mountains that fit this description. The mountain that fits this description is Elbruz, and it is for exactly these reasons that we find Prometheus on Elbruz. Prometheus, like Adam, is the progenitor of humanity – our first father. Prometheus, like the Serpent, in Eden, gave knowledge to humans. Christianity brought ancient conflations of Prometheus with these Edenic figures, the question is if those conflations were already there. The myth of Prometheus literally represents the association of Prometheus with Sunrise by locating him on the tallest mountain at the world’s eastern edge, Elbruz. If the description of Eden in the East, at the sunrise, and on the tallest mountain, we have to at least ask, could Elbruz be an inspiration for Eden? The vision of the Caucasus as the place of the sunrise was shared by the Greeks and Egyptians when Genesis was written. Could it have been similarly shared by Jews?\n\nThe first home of the Hebrews was Eden, which was located in the East, where the sun rises, and on the world’s tallest mountain. When this was written, Hebrews were sharing the Mediterranean with Greek and Egyptian sailors who understood the sun as rising from mountains in the Caucasus, the tallest of which was Elbruz. This is where Greeks located their progenitor, Prometheus, who, like Adam, was father to humanity. Khazaria emerged as an empire many centuries after we begin seeing C\n\nEden is located on the tallest mountain and at the sunrise, in the east. Prometheus is located at the sunrise, in the east and on Europe’s tallest mountain, Elbruz. This is to say, the Christian conflation of Prometheus and Pandora with Adam and Eve comes with the conflation of Eden with Elbruz. Elbruz is in the Caucasus.\n\nThe tallest mountain in the world known to Jews during the time of Genesis was likely the same tallest mountain in the world known to their fellow Mediterranean travelers from Greece and Egypt, Elbruz, who jointly recognized the Caucasus as the location of sunrise. Khazaria is in the Caucasus, in the mountains that were jointly associated with sunrise by the Mediterranean culture in which Israel shared. The tallest mountain in the Caucasus, in the world known to Mediterranean travelers,\n\nThe first home of the Hebrews, according to tradition, was Eden. Eden, it was said, is located at the sunrise, in the East, on the tallest mountain. This description fits Khazaria and the Caucasus mountains, which were recognized by the Greeks and Egyptians as that eastern mountain range of the sunrise. This is where we find the Greek father of humanity, Prometheus, on Elbruz, in the East, at the sunrise, on the world’s tallest mountain.\n\nEden is located on top of the tallest mountain, where the sun rises, in the east. When Genesis was written, the Greeks and Egyptians shared a view of the Caucasus mountains as the eastern boundary over which the sun rises. In Greek myth, the tallest mountain in the Caucasus, indeed the tallest in their world, Elbruz, is where we find Prometheus—at the sunrise. Greek sailors traded goods in Israeli ports before, during and after the writing of Genesis. If they were to hear about a place called Eden on the tallest mountain at the Eastern edge of the world where the progenitor of humanity was located, they would have thought—that’s Elbruz."

At this time, both Russia and America were spending a lot of resources on paranormal and parapsychological research.  So as the rise of secularism left a hole in the existential spirits of populations, they transferred their projections from religious figures—like angels and demons—to the more scientifically oriented aliens and paranormal research."

          "text": "Richard Gear and a good screenplay have a lot to do with why we still tell the myth, but there’s also something interesting about the way this particular story avoids the recognizable mythic trappings that lead others to dismissal. There’s something about how secular it feels as an event—paranormal, but secular. The Mothman is not easily identifiable as anything that’s already been dismissed—aliens, Demons, reptilian illuminati. Speaking for myself here, I feel more free to project my own possibilities into the narrative—and these range from quantum speculations about the timeless of soul to mundane dismissals of statistical anomalies. The lack of identifiable detail enables people to project their own."

          "text": "Ancient Aliens, I’m coming at ya! Sometimes the fact that deities come from above is a metaphor; and sometimes technology from the heavens means iron tools made from meteorites. The conflation of from the heavens with deities from space is just an updated form of reductive literalism.\n\nTalking about different mythologies, what bird like creatures meant in different cultures and draw similarities to the Mothman\n\nBirds represent an ability to traverse multiple domains—especially water birds that can dive below waves as well as fly above them. This has led to their association with celestial lights that fly through the sky and swim through the sea. It’s also led to their association with the soul, which can hopefully travel between worlds. The mothman, similarly, is seen as a being that straddles realities.\n\nAncient Sumerian and Babylonian deities tend to have 2-4 wings. When there are four wings, two point up and two down, like the Mayan deity associated with Venus and bees. My interpretation is that the up and down direction of wings pertains to the ability of a celestial object to go up and come down. We know that the winged disk they ride was associated with the sun, sorry again, Ancient Aliens.\n\nMoths and Men are of two totally different genus, which means their actual blending is likely to be more surreal than biological. That having been said, as John Colarusso points out, hybrid children of dueling cultures were often created very intentionally and for the purpose of creating a bridge. IF there were aliens, a hybrid would be instrumental in such a bridge, and IF there were such a hybrid, maybe the conflict between alien powers and human sympathies could have led a mothman to try and avert a human tragedy.\n\nThe moth, like a butterfly, has transformed from a more primitive form. This relates to the belief of some that Mothmen are what we see when we look at our future incarnations. Interesting that it’s not a butterfly but a moth, whose association with the night can be conflated with an association with death. Both are symbolic of resurrection, but where the Butterfly resurrects into day, the Moth remains in night. This is consistent with the notion that the mothman comes from somewhere beyond, before or beneath life. ."

Also like the Mothman, this creature is associated with disaster, in this case lightning strikes, and is believed to be immortal. It’s especially associated with witchcraft and vampirism.\n\nIf the bridge collapse were to be seen as just retribution for crimes against natives, the Mothman might be compared with the furies – winged deities who execute hellacious forms of justice.\n\nBad Luck deities are often associated with seafaring, from the Nain Rouge (or Red Dwarf) to the old belief that women were bad luck on a ship. Another example of a bad luck deity can be found in Fear Gorta, another Irish figure who responds to the lack of hospitality by instilling bad luck.\n\nBad luck is especially associated with curses, which are often levied by witches and other deities."

The Mythopoeic Society just celebrated their 50th anniversary – a group that cosplayed before cosplay was a thing—for lord of the rings. By now we have Comic Con – by now cosplay is HUGE.

I think myths emerge where patterns converge.\n\nToo many people want to flatten myths into allegories – as though they can be reduced to a single inspiration. Bor-ring! Says the imagination. Too easy for a mind too smart. Allegories are but threads in the cloth of the quilt that is myth\n\nMyths emerge where patterns converge – the myth of Osiris is the story of night and day, death and life, wake and sleep, harvest and growth, displaced Pharoahs and new reigns...all at once. Myths are made of synesthesia. Crescent horns become crescent moons become crescent blades become crescent tusks—all at once! In myth, something’s pattern drags in the meaning of everything else with that pattern. And through pattern, myth mixes the human with nature, with animals, with the heavens."

          "text": "The solar day and year weren’t just clocks for Neolithic humans, nor were these monuments. They were built to align the journeys of life and death with the rhythms of creation.\n\nWhen people participate in ritual together, they don’t feel alone, and loneliness is one of the great curses of humanity, which can turn into hate and violence if not resolved. So if we learn anything from these monuments, it should be the importance of being together.\n\nThese great monuments enabled early humans to synchrionize with one another by aligning with the world. This provided major relief to the all to common experience of lonely estrangement, which becomes violence and hate, if not resolved.\n\nThe alignment of human life with the solar journey isn’t just about having a healthy and prosperous life, aligning with the winter solstice is about aligning the self with renewal—if not eternity.\n\nThe division of religion and culture is a recent development, so when we think of the practical and technological value of aligning a society with the sun, we cannot separate the spiritual quality of this alignment. Ok, yes, it helped with farming and organizing life, but it also helped the individual feel in participation — with each other and with the cosmos. Aren’t all our worst problems today the product of estranged lonely individuals? And so even the spiritual answer isn’t just spiritual, there’s practical value to making sure there aren’t extremely alienated individuals who would damage society.\n\nThe Summer and Winter Solstice are the turning points of the year, with which megaliths are often aligned. At the Zenith of the Summer Solstice, the year reaches its height and begins to cool and darken. At the Winter Solstice, the days transition from getting colder, darker, drier and more dead to warmer, wetter, brighter and more alive. And it’s not just the resurrection of nature we associate with this solar return—this is also the core metaphor for the resurrection of an individual, which is why Easter is celebrated at sunrise."

And it’s not just the resurrection of nature we associate with the solar return—this is also the core metaphor for the resurrection of an individual, which is why Easter is celebrated at sunrise.\n\nMany megalithic monuments are solar calendars, some are lunar calendars, some track the movements of Venus and some track the journey of earth through its seasons. Calendar, however, is a reductive term. They weren’t just keeping time. They were participating in it. If you know when teatime is, you can have tea with everyone—emphasis on, with everyone. Modern lovers of astrology may want to know what’s going on up there so they know how it’s influencing them down here, but what alignment with the heavens is really about is just alignment — it’s about setting tea times with the cosmos."

Womb to tomb?\n\nEntering a dark temple is a full sensory experience. Your eyes will have to adjust to the darkness within seconds. There are only little flickering lights of candles illuminating the space. Next thing you see are lifesized images of saints who stare directly at you. It smells of incense, the temperature drops. Your entire body is forced to immediately adapt. And then there's deep and rhythmic chanting piercing through your body. That hits every sense.\n\nTo enter a megalithic temple was like entering an even more ancient ritual cave. It was to cross a threshold into a completely different environment than the outside world.

And could they have anything to do with the Greek and Hebrew records of stone assembled with sound. .\n\nTRIANGLE: By the time of the Greeks, the triangle was a symbol of fire, change, knowledge and power, but the use of triangulation to gain power over the changing world by reading heavenly fire could have be a Neolithic breakthrough.\n\nToday, as it was in ancient history, the triangle is a symbol of change and energy, fire or light. And if we look even further back, to pre-history, we find early humans gaining power over change with the help of triangulation, which enabled them to read and predict the heavenly fire lights.\n\nReading the stars is all about triangulation, which gave humans power.  humans to predict and control change. The triangle emerged as a symbol of knowledge, light and change.  For Neolithic humans, triangulation was used for power over change.\n\nCircles convey cyclical completion — like that of a day, year or life. They also convey the notion of inner and outer. Megaliths prioritize inner circles and anyone who did not participate in the ritual holidays would have been left out. Like a music festival today, some people would have journeyed to sites they saw as centers of essential activity. Others would have gone out of fomo, or fear of missing out.\n\nSquares appear as symbols of material solidity — even a three dimensional triangle has four sides – like a square. This is why the root chakra in the Hindu tradition is represented by a square. Even basic experience tells us that a foundation becomes sturdy with a fourth side."

In the first well documented epic quest for immortality, Gilgamesh landed on the conclusion that his immortality would be preserved in a stone monument. That’s what these are — at least for us today, monuments of great humans and  ancient memtories.\n\nPARTICIPATION & ESTRANGEMENT\n\nThere’s a big leap you have to take to understand megaliths, and it’s not that hard, t you have to take it. Megaliths are about PARTICIPATION—participation with nature, participation with cosmos and with other humans. By aligning the individual w the rituals of the monument the individual became aligned — socially, professionally and spiritually, with each other and their world. This participation has practical and social benefits, but first and foremost, it’s the spiritual answer of the day to the devil of estrangement.\n\nFrom Adam and Satan to a modern shooter, the pain they feel is estrangement — separation from the divine and from one another. That’s why we go to music festivals and parties and churches—to be with, to be in participation—with each other and our world. Aligning rituals with monuments aligned with the heavens and earth created an existential experience of alignment between the individual and their reality, which is perhaps the most important experience for a human.\n\nMore key one liners.\n\nWe learned to dance by imitating the dances of reality around us—from the movements of moon to the dance of deer. From these dances and movements came ritual gestures, like the folding of hands when we pray, or spell casting of a dramatic wizard.\n\nEarly dance and ritual gestures came from the imitation of nature—from animals and stars to plants and storms. Like folding our hands when we pray, participate in these gestures was to participate in the divine.\n\nBurial chambers and mythic underworlds often look like one another, for example, as in Valhalla, we find a central pillar and hanging sword in the burial mounds we call Kurgans."

Megaliths, great monuments of stone, give eternity to all who build them. To participate in the building of an enduring monument is to transcend the limited range of time in which the individual lives.\n\nBrilliant individuals in the last hundred years have shown an ability to move fifteen ton stones and create massive monuments entirely on their own with a combination of basic pulleys, levers and the clever use of pebbles.\n\nIn Ancient Mesopotamia, important texts were inscribed in clay and paper because one survives flood and the other survives fire—monuments, can survive both."

To build a Wonder of the World takes such a beautiful and comprehensive push of so many people all working together. This is the miracle of civilization itself.\n\nToday, if you wanted everyone to be all in on a great challenge, like the Moon Shot, you’re going to have to activate the athletes and scientists alike, the students of the sky and the masters of material science.

That is what we should feel when we see them. They are the death of arrogance. Anyone who thinks they can explain them fully runs up against something impossible they have to leave out. How were stones moved, how were they cut and placed, and how in the hell do you get the level of mass participation required to build them? If you think they were built w the help of lost powers, technology or aliens, arrogance dies at the threshold of proof. You just can’t get there with certainty. If you think it was done by humans, the disconnect between the actual achievements and the technologies  we know they had during the dates with which we associate the monuments, huge gaps are left or denied.\n\nThe Dolmon Chapel in Portugal, which has become a church, shows us how ancient ruins can be integrated into new religions. All over the world, religious sites sit on older religious sites. Megaliths the world over have been integrated into worship that has little to do with the spiritual intentions of their builders.

Until we recognize that all of these are relevant, we’ll remain blind. These monuments were the center points for weaving, integrating and participating in reality. This is where they aligned their stories with their worship with their sexuality with their crops with the seasons and the stars. Mayan kings sat on mats on which all the stories of their world were woven. The center and position of leadership is where all the stories weave together, and when you are in that center, when you are in the moments and locations where the lights of the heavens align with your life and your world, you feel at one with the cosmos. And it made everything you did feel one with the cosmos — not just your spiritual practice, but also your ball games and your farming and your love life.\n\nThe purpose of funeral rituals are typically to ensure an afterlife. All the work to prepare an individual in Egypt is to ensure they are able to empty their tomb, like Jesus or like Hercules who leaves behind only his empty armor.

It is a big part of human history in which we were talking major next steps. All of our major next steps were incubated with and in these megaliths. Like a seed that would define a whole society, the core patterns enacted ritually and by the heavenly lights with in the monuments would encode the ways we lived beyond — like going to church on Sundays and for a holiday then being Christian at all other times. You go to take communion and get aligned then go be out and about. Same.

And this isn’t just about how myth is reduced to history, far from it, I’m interested in how history becomes endowed with myth. Arthur gives us another great example, as a historical figure (or five) who became a magnet for mythic material.\n\nOn one hand the dueling families represent the dueling mythic pantheons of the Asuras and Devas or Ahuras and Devas or Olympians and Titans... on another, it’s a historic narrative...\n\nEvolution & Time: A story we can see evolve across a large span of space and time. In addition to the three tight waves of the Poetic Edda, Nibelung Saga and Saga of the Volsungs written down between the 10th and 13th century, Wagner carries these stories into the 19th century, which are built on motifs that extend into ancient memory.\n\nMetal: Personally, I’m interested in the mythopoeic expressions of iron-work. For example, the strength of Siegfried’s blade comes from plunging it in blood and his single weakness is the leaf that covered him when he bathed. These details pertain to the tempering of iron, which is strengthened by dipping it in cool water but is weak where held in the process. This is a motif shared with achilles and Sosruquo, in whom the origin is apparent. Not only is he freed from stone and dipped in water by a blacksmith, he is also described as steel and is only vulnerable where held when dipped. This is probably an older story, which is more poeticized by the time we get to Achilles and even more so by the time we get to Siegfried. But though Superman, Iron Man and Wolverine are dressed far differently, these men of steel all carry its core motifs.\n\nPsychologically: The story is certainly interesting from a psychological point of view. If it was a dream, what would be going on in the mind of that dreamer? Jungians are certainly interested in the dragon slaying motif. Some see it as a defeat and subjucation of one’s own inner monster or ego, some see it as the defeat and subjugation of the feminine or earthly principle by masculine solar consciousness. We can certainly see the connection between the dragon faced by Siegfried and the serpents or dragons seen in Eden or blocking the boundary to the Egyptian Underworld.\n\nWarrior Women: One of my interests are mythical warrior women, ever since I had a cruch on Teela from He-Man; and so I’m very interested in the Valkyries and Amazons. One of the most cheaveneistic things I’ve ever heard is that women warriors are masculinized heroes; as though Artemis, Amazan and Brunhilde never were—not Sekhmet or the Maenadic fighters. One of the motifs we see is the ritual fight between Brunhilde and her suitor. This is seen in the story of Atalanta and might date back to a ritual in which men and women litereally met their match. We also see the emphasis on her girdle, like Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons.\n\nIn the story, Siegfried actually enters the bedchamber in an invisible form to subdue Brunhilde.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the story in which an invisible mesh us used by Hephaestus to capture Aphrodite’s infidelity – a story that Newton saw as a particular copper-iron alloy."

          "text": "Orally delivered content is much more likely to be delivered in verse, because rhythm and meter support the memory and focus of the storyteller and audience. AND, Verse brings artfulness—it’s like cinematography for words.\n\nMeaning can be embedded in any pattern, including verse. For example, Homeric meter is called dactylic, a word for fingers applied to the deities that elevated Zeus. In this way, you might see meter as the hand of God. Of course this resonates with the Egyptian and New Testament ideas of God’s creation with the word."

          "question": "Siegfried is murdered by Hagen, in the only place on the back that is vulnerable (a leaf has prevented the dragon's blood from making him invulnerable here). What does that remind you of?",
          "text": "The most famous comparison is Achilles, whose weak spot is also where he was dipped when made impervious. Both are later poeticizations of earlier figures that more clearly reveal the steel origins of this motif. Sosruquo, from the Caucasus, is weak in his thighs, where the black smith held him with tongs and tempered him before calling the child steel. In this story, it’s on the surface, and it shows us what’s really going on with Siegfried, Achilles and Jason, who, like Siegfried, baths in a special elixir to become impervious, and like Sosruquo, becomes impervious in the Caucasus mountains. In his case, the magic ingredient comes from a flower that grows at the sunrise, from Prometheus‘ gore, where the Eagle eats his liver. The fire of Prometheus was associated with metallurgy and iron, which appeared in the Caucasus far earlier than almost anywhere else. It was then under the instruction of Hekate that this gift of Prometheus was prepared by Medea for Jason. The impervious skin enables him to withstand fire and defeat dragons. Such association of the impervious skin with dragons is also found in the Caucasus, where the charcoal used to make steel is described as the bones of dragons.\n\nOne might ask – how come they kept using tongs to dip steel if they knew about the weak spot? Hilariously enough, they shifted to stories in which the knees wouldn’t fit below the trough of water—as though there was an effort being made to retain the motif of a single weakness despite the technological solution.\n\nThe single weakness of the steel heroes is also conflated with the corruption of steel and the heroes through which it’s personified. The single weakness of Achilles becomes the place on the body where he sacriligously injurs Hektor, who he witholds from burial while draging around Troy by his achilles heels. This small corruption of the strongest hero is a mythopoetic expression of steel itself, which is stronger (and more immprtal) as a result of its corruption—carbon. Personified, this is the Anti-Hero, which we also recognize in the Steel Narts, Sosruquo and Batraz, who are simultaneously the strongest heroes and at odds with the divine order.\n\nPurity & Fire The focus on purity, which is required to pass through Brunhiilde’s firewall, is also a motif associated with metal and steel heroes. For centuries, the purity of metals was the path towards their quality if not immortality. This was mythopoeically consistent the religious understanding of self --- that it should be purified to achieve strength and immortality. Such golden boys can be seen all throughout mythology—Gallahad, for example. And among the Narts, their metal is only as strong as their people are courageous, and honest.The quality of the people’s mettle translated into the quality of their metal.  This is what’s going on with Siegfried. However, with the discovery of steel came the discovery of a metal that was lighter, stronger and more immortal when mixed with impurity. This is seen in the personification of this material in the form of heroes who are at once the strongest, but who are also corrupt.\n\nVoices – I love how Siegfried hears the birds and the bees when he tastes the blood of the dragon. It’s like an inversion of the Eden myth, where the ability to speak with the animals is lost as a result of eating the fruit. We see the same thing in the Grimm Fairytalle called White Snake, where a servant of the king gains the power of hearing animals when eating a bit of the king’s secret dish—a white snake. And we get another example of the motif when Fin burns his thumb with oil from a great fish, which gives him wisdom. It’s like a return to the pre-edenic wisdom of Adam, or, even better, a completion of a journey that’s led back to such wisdom. Psychologically, one might suggest that the defeat of one’s inner tyrant or ego, which is focused on consciousness and reason, permits the restoration of one’s relationship with emotion and intuition. Sufi’s mystics believe we should clean the mirrors of our heart – this is consistent with the idea that we have to empty and free ourselves of ego, will or spirit so that something greater than ourselves can come through and be heard. Some see this as what’s going on when Sigfried has defeated the dragon and tasted its blood.\n\nThe single weakness is symbolized by the Linden leaf, which represents Freya and is a symbol of truth. Like someone in the golden lasso of Wonderwoman, it’s impossible to tell a lie when under the Linden tree. This connects that weakness back to noble honesty and purity. Siegfried, as a man of steel, is not perfectly honest or without corruption. In fact his fatal flaw involved his lie about sleeping with his friend’s wife, which led to a spear in his weak spot."

          "question": "Can stories like the Nibelungenlied really have a real core?",
          "text": "In the Nibelung, History, myth and metallurgy align around core patterns capable of reflecting more than just historical, mythic or metallurgical meaning. For example, the single weakness of quenched steel becomes the single weakness of a hero’s personality becomes the mythic downfall of a historic culture. The pattern of the single weakness then sustains the projection of whatever flaw concerns its audience.\n\nMyth is like nuclear fusion, it requires the combination of multiple cores to create something new. Is the core of the Nibelungenlied a set of Germanic or older Indo-European motifs? Is it grounded in metallurgy? History? Is it woven around the deep wound of a fallen culture? Is it constructured for the spiritual or psychological training of the audience—like a dream? I find searching for a single core to be perilous if not reductive. History, myth and metallurgy become aligned around core patterns, which support layers of meaning beyond anticipation\n\nMetallurgical core: One of the core inspirations to the Nibelung is metallurgy—from Siegfried’s personification of ancient iron with impervious skin and a single weakness to his magnificent sword and the focus on rings.\n\nCore Wound: The Nibelung revolves around a wound—symbolically, this is the wound of Siegfried’s, but it is also the wound of a fallen culture, which his death portends.\n\nIndo European: An Indo-European core can be recognized in several motifs. The most striking examples involve ancient mating rituals—from competitive matching with warrior women to the way Siegfried pretends to be Gunnar in bed—an act that can be compared with the conception of both Hercules and Arthur.\n\nPsychological: From Jung’s point of view, the defeat of the dragon was the defeat of the inner tyrant that limited the flow of life’s forces. The defeat of the dragon and Sigfried’s new ability to understand nature become seen as outward mythopoeic expressions of an inner transformation—one that inverts the fall of Adam.\n\nCheauvenism: One of the cores, unfortunately, is a conflation of women with the fall. This is seen in figures that range from Eve and Delilah to Helen, Guinevere and Kriemhild—this is the archetypal woman who is a beautiful and seductive wife who brings a whole world to ruin. This has been one of the more damaging archetypes in human history, and it’s ultimately related to the conflation of the mother with matter, both of which go by Mater in Latin, and which share the root word with Matrix and Matriarchy. This is based on an understanding of the woman as the vessel from which all life is born, like the earth. In this way the mother is a personification of the earth – both fertil wombs and vessels, but also, both matter. Everything comes from the matter of mothers, which comes from the matter of earth. This sets up the story of the spirit’s fall into matter, which recognizes the spirit, like semen, as masculine, and the body, like the womb, as feminine. Thus the religious battle between spirit and body is symbolized as a tension between the masculine reason of spirit and the body’s feminine emotions."

Spiritual training also comes in the form of metaphors and patterns that remain hidden to those focused most on the surface.\n\nI think there’s also something just existentially authoritiative to us about what’s big for all of us – what reaches all of us – just that it’s so significant to so many, it tells us it’s significant and make sus want to understand.."

There’s a lot of nitrate in goose poop, so if it was mixed with powdered metals that were then melted down, it could create some good iron.\n\nThat having been said, my tendency is to see the goose poop as just as an alchemical symbol. The goose, often conflated with the swan, is believed to have layed the cosmic egg, and it’s from the goose egg that came Helen and her siblings. The goose is also a symbol of the sun. And so I can’t be sure that the droppings of the goose don’t relate to a symbol of something else, perhaps even something that, like goose poop, falls from the sky.

          "text": "Swords are incredible symbols – the first long swords were made of iron, and the first iron was made of meteorites – so the first sword is a meteor sword, which colors its symbol forever. In that the sword is made of a light from heaven, it’s often associated with the divine right of rule—as seen in the Arthur myth. In that the sword is a death bringer made of a fallen light, the fiery sword can also represent the fall—as seen in the Eden myth. In that it cuts, it can be associated with knowledge. The same can be said of fire, which is symbolized by the triangle, or blade, even still. The word Science comes from a root word that means to cut or divide, which highlights the notion of knowledge as discerning. At the same time, to cut is to divide into two, which highlights a dualistic vision of knowledge. In the Tibetan and Jedi tradition, the flaming sword is the instrument used to cut oneself free of attachment and ignorance.\n\nGRAIL SWORD - The great sword of Sigurd is Gram, which shares the same prefix as the grail, as grain grapes and grass.\n\nThe sword is retrieved in a manner similar to that of Excalibur. When Odin thrusts it into a tree, he declares that it will belong to who can retrieve it. This related to an old Indo-European ritual in which the sword of the deceased hung on the central pillar of the kurgan burial mound; it also relates to the old motif of retrieving the father’s weaponry from a tomb-like basement—sometimes even a dead horse. In the case of Sigfried, like Arthur, Theseus and the Nart heroes, he inherits the sword from his father.\n\nThe sword of his father, however, like the sword destine for Aragorn, has been split in two. But when it is remade, when Sigfried learns how to work the forge, it is restored to its great strength. Not only can it cut an anvil in half, it’s so strong, it can also cut floating wool, it’s so sharp.\n\nAs with the sword of Atilla and Arthur, the sword of Siegfied vanishes with him.\n\nThe sword is used as a symbol of chastity when laid between Siegfried and Brunhild, which is afotif that repeats throughout Arthurian legend."

The Nazis wanted to see themselves as the direct descendants and inheritors of this language and culture group, which it wanted to see as racial; but the Indo-European language cannot be pinned to a single race, and the Germans are no more the inheritors of that tradition than any of the others. They aren’t the oldest wave of Indo-Europeans to hit Europe, and they aren’t the youngest. Either way, many of the European motifs seen as Celtic, Classical, Norse or Germanic are more fairly classified as Indo-European. For example, as John Colarusso points out, the hanging of Odin’s sword on the central pillar of Valhalla mimes the hanging of the sword on the central column of the Indo-European Kurgan or Burial Mound, which is to say, this Norse myth carries a memory of the much earlier Indo Europeans.\n\nSimilarly, the swords of Batraz, Arthur and Atilla are all returned to water when they die. This motif pertains to metallurgical breakthroughs of early Indo Europeans.\n\nJohn Colarusso has argued that the more direct continuation of Indo-European culture can be seen near their homeland in the Caucasus, where horse-riding and pastoral lifestyles were maintained."

It has to do with the invisibility of the dead and the lack of visibility in the night, which is intuitively understood anywhere. Death and darkness, death and night—these are aligned in myths just about everywhere.\n\nIs it as simple as the fact that fighter pilots have to be short and that dwarves made good miners? Or that dwarves were lumped in with the one-eyed and injured who were of more value making armor than wearing it? There are always literal layers… but then there’s also the way these images play in dreams while miming patterns beyond belief. For Freud, the little man represents the penis, which enters the mother’s cave. If you’re reductive, you pick one answer. If you’re honest about how the imagination of artists and audiences work, you realize that the more answers there are, the further these stories go. The dwarf is also associated with the little man in your head—ever done enough drugs to see him in there choosing between the thousands of thoughts you ignored for this one? We saw the image in Men in Black and across the Enlightenment. Thousand Frames – Dwarf of a thousand frames. If you’re an alchemist, the dwarf represents the homunculus or little self, which either symbolizes the self on which you work while creating the philosophers stone or is some actual literal little creature—think the Golum. You see this image in Jodorowsky’s Holy Mountain. If you worship Shiva, then you see the dwarf beneath his dancing feet as a symbol of his own conquered ignorance – the ignorance of the little grubby egoic self that tries to pull the levers and mine for gold… We could go on. On one level it’s key to see how the various expressions of the image resonate and relate to one another; on another, it’s essential to wake up from hypnotic projections of such myths onto real people. It’s not fair or kind. The same can be said of the way caucasians project their own shadow on the dark skin of others.\n\nDwarf as opposite of giants, giants as mountains and elements, dwarves as us – the little crafty ones who can outsmart and outcraft the titans of nature or industry or government or religion. Dwarves are the little guy or underdog and those fighting against tyrant – see Bilbo or Willow. In this way, they’re also associated with Children, who look up at the big unknown world of giants.\n\nFor Nietzsche, all the things society thinks thou shalt do have been accumulating as scales on the dragon, Holdfast. The Ubermench is the hero who sees that the status quo is managed by the tyranny of this dragon, thou shalt, which he slays.\n\nFor Tolkien, the Dragon was also a tyrant, and more specifically a hoarder. The dragon bursting forth from the mountain with fire in the Hobbit is aligned with the eruption of Mount Doom in Lord of the Rings. Both climax with the eruption and flow of a mountain – both are concerned with overcoming the desire to hoard and keep wealth and power – this is the tyrants impulse, which is represented by the Dragon and its gold as well as the Mayor and his wealth. The flow of wealth from the mountain and the eruption of the volcano are both representations of the Tyrant’s violent defeat and the subsequent restoration of life’s healthy flow. In this way, his notion of the Dragon’s defeat is not particularly different than Nietzche’s or Jung’s. In all cases, the Dragon is seen as that which is hoarding the flow of life in a tyrannical way, which becomes associated with the self-centered nature of the ego, which seeks the role of tyrant within the psyche.\n\nSets the Mythical fall of the Gods during the Historic Fall of Rome and within the fall of a specific family."

Built by the 4th dynasty of pharaohs by the kings Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos (2590 - 2470 BC).  There is said to have been a fourth pyramid in Abu Rawash, about 8 km north of Giza, which dwarfed all the other structures. Built by a pharaoh Djedefre, also called Radjedef. Many mysteries surround this pharaoh. This much is certain: he was a son of Cheops. But why did he build his pyramid so far away from his family?"

Since Djedefre built on a mountain, his pyramidion was 20 metres higher than that of Giza. Djedefre used the logistically good building site to be able to build as high as possible in the shortest possible time.  On the east side of the pyramid, Chris discovers a kind of ramp, which presumably leads to the underground burial shaft. This must have been the sarcophagus of the pharaoh Djedefre.\n\nThe burial chamber was now again built underground, as in the pyramids of the 3rd Dynasty. It seems that Djedefre was a real pragmatist."

In the case of the pyramids we are specifically looking at Ra’s light beams from above meeting Egypt below. this also represents the descending of Ra’s authority to the pharoah, who rules in his name. And so we see the rise of pyramids in Egypt concur with the rise of emphasis on Ra and Pharaohs who identify as his sons.\n\nThe Egyptian perception of sunbeams as Piramidal can be seen in the extended arms of aten that reach down in triangular form from the sun and in the pyramid itself, who’s Kapstone was associated with the sun at its zenith.\n\nMount Hermon is where the Angels come down to mate with humans. Mt. Sinai is where God came to give Moses his word. Zeus and Indra are atop their mountains, and Pharoahs build pyramids.\n\nThe Cosmic Mountain wasn’t just a place over there, it was once a symbol for all of existence. Falling from Eden wasn’t about falling from some random mountain, it was about falling from the center and top of existence. The mountain is a symbol of existence itself. The top is where God creates the first humans and communes with them—whether it’s Eden or Sinai. This is where the tree of life sprouts and where Angels mate with humans.\n\nThe core existential question is and always has been if and how we can participate meaningfully in existence. For as long as we can remember, this existential need has produced efforts to align the individual and society with nature and cosmos. The individual wants to participate in our universal drama in meaningful ways. The alignment of monuments with stars and seasons is common around the world, but the first and most foundational metaphor is the mountain or tree, which represent the union of above with below."

          "question": "Why was the path to the burial chamber built at an angle of 27 degrees?",
          "text": "The path of the burial chamber is built at an angle of 27° to point at the pole star, which the Egyptians associated with rebirth — why? It’s the center around which our sky revolves, the one fixed spot in all of human experience, which sometimes appears in myth as the unmovable spot or center of reality. In the case of the Egyptian‘s, this was also recognized as the top most point of the cosmos. So when the djed pillar provides a ladder to heaven, it’s to the polestar, and it’s constellation, the adze, which For the Egyptians was an opener of the way for seed and soul.\n\n(Images: Seth poking the way through up office with a was scepter, An ads being used to till the earth. A image of the opening of the mouth ceremony, one with the was scepter. An image of the was constellation.)\n\nWhat’s interesting about this of course is that the Djed pillar is a representation of Osiris . So the pyramid becomes the jet pillar to the top of the sky, which is seen in the pole star. What then is the constellation that the pole star is in? At one point in Egypt it was the leg of Seth, and later, it became the adze of Seth. The ads is what we use to cut through things and it was used ceremonially to open the mouth of the pharaoh for the soul to re-enter the body. And so we see this ad in the sky cutting a hole for the soul to climb through, and we see the chamber in the pyramid pointing the soul directly to that point.\n\nThe pole star is the only spot in all of existence that, from our perspective, isn’t moving. In the story of the Buddha, this is called, the immovable spot. It is the center of existence, and it is where Siddartha sits when he sits beneath the world tree. The world tree, like the Djed pillar and Acacia tree in Ancient Egypt, is a bridge from below to above. When Osiris is reborn from the Acacia tree, he is reborn through the Djed pillar, which is the Egyptian ladder to heaven. The ladder to heaven, like the tree of life, is teathered to the immovable spot. This is where the chambers of the pyramid are pointing. This is what they are aligning with. They are aligning with the point to which we climb when we climb the ladder to Heaven. This is the alignment of the Djed pillar.\n\nThe pole star is the immovable spot in our reality. Everything else moves. Not the pole star, which is the center.\n\nFor the Egyptians, the pole star was part of a constellation called the Adze, which was previously known as the leg of Seth. The Adze is a cutting instrument, which can be seen cutting its way through our cosmic ceiling. But why the Leg? The leg of Seth was later replaced with a ceremonial Adze known as the Was scepter, a symbol of Seth. Both were used in what was called the opening of the mouth ceremony, which is when the Ba Soul, which has journeyed through the netherworld, returns to the body. There is no more integral moment to the Egyptian hope for life eternal. Interesting to see the instrument associated with our pole star, as though the depositing of the Ba soul is through the top of our existence. This was associated with the primary role of the Adze, which was to dig a way for seeds to be deposited in the earth.\n\nWe see Osiris with three instruments in his hand — a was scepter, djed pillar and Akh. These three symbols are keys to the reincarnation process. Where the Akh, like the cross, symbolizes resurrection, the Was symbolizes the ability to penetrate into another reality, and the Djed is a ladder to heaven. The ladder to heaven might be seen as pointing towards the pole star, the top of our reality, where we find a constellation they knew as the adze, or was."

          "text": "In the same way a divine monarch of europe derives authority from a Christian god, a pharaoh derives authority from the sun god Ra, who governs the living day and guides our souls  through night and death. These roles are conferred on his son Osiris who the Pharoah becomes when he or she dies And who confers them again to Horace the next Pharoah. That the lineage of the Pharoah points back to ra and the suns authority was absolutely imperative.\n\nDjedefre was the first Pharoah to declare himself the son of Ra, which the Pharoahs continued for thousands of years until even their conqueror, Alexander the Great, was received as Ra’s Son. As the lord of daily and annual rhythms, the sun presents an image of governance, leadership and stability. These are qualities with which monarchs have identified all over the world and for as long as we can remember. The sun, however, doesn’t just govern the day, it journeys through night and promises a new sunrise. This is what we see in the Pyramid texts, the journey of Pharoahs, in the form of Osiris, from sunset to sunrise, from death to rebirth; and in this journey we don’t just see the resurrection of an individual, we see the annual return of Nile floods and the life they bring, we see the cyclical defeat of occupying invaders, and we see the eternal renewal of Egypt itself.\n\nDjedefre became seen as the son of Ra when he gave rise to a tradition that lasted thousands of years and would be emulated by Alexander the Great, when he declared himself Pharoah and the son of God."

This is for the same reason the fourth pyramid was likely built on a mountain — because the core symbolism was inspired by the mountain.\n\nThe shape of the pyramid represents the hierarchical power structure of ra governing the cosmos and the pharaoh governing Egypt. In The same way the sun at its height rules over creation, the Pharoah at his or her height rules over Egypt. This shape is still definitive for us today as the pattern for capitalism, monotheism and monarchy.\n\nThis structure is then saturated by amplifications that include the triangular shape of refracted sunbeams and build on the symbolic heritage of the holy mountain as where above meets below.\n\n“I am he of the Djed pillar,” says Osiris, as he enters the underworld, says the dead Pharoah, as he takes on the role of Osiris. The Djed pillar is Osiris’ ladder to heaven and forerunner of the pyramid.\n\nLike Holy Mountains and Tree tops, the root metaphor of a pyramid comes from the fact that it rises to the heavens, for which reason, like the older symbolism of mountains and trees, pyramids present the meeting of heaven and earth. Eden, Zeus and the Ten Commandments — all on mountain tops.\n\nMountain and Treetops appear in the mythological records as places where human and divine — above and below — converge. In Egypt, the archetypal qualities of the divine mountain become seen in the Pyramid, and the qualities of the tree are seen in what they call the Djed pillar, “I am of the Djed pillar,” says the pharoah who dies and becomes Osiris.\n\nThe pyramidal structure of the Ziggurat had been around for centuries, and mythology of holy mountains had been around for millennia by the time Egyptians began building pyramids, Like pyramids all over the world, they were seen as a meeting place with the divine—where below meets above.\n\nThe pyramidal structure of the Sumerian Ziggurat had been around for centuries by the time\n\nAs a man made mountain, the pyramid inherits the symbolic meaning of holy mountains."

          "text": "The Pyramids are inseparable from the Pyramid texts, also known as the book of the dead, which tells the story of a dead Pharoah’s journey to resurrection. This journey took place on a solar barque. So when the builder of the great pyramid died, his son, Djedefre, gave him a splended ship.\n\nWhen the builder of the great pyramid died his son Jeff Ray gave him a splendid ship in the image of the solar park which appears in the pyramid texts as the boat on which the dead pharaoh will journey through the underworld. This is to say we know he actively participated in the funerary rights of his father, which is not consistent with the idea that he destroyed his statues. In fact, to have not completed the funerary rights for his father, would have been seen as a betrayal of his duty to all Egyptian’s who will journey to the afterlife.\n\nThe pyramids are inseparable from the pyramid texts, also known as the book of the dead, which tells the story of a pharoah’s journey from death to new life. This journey culminates in a ritual performed by his son in which the individual’s spirit and soul reunite in their corpse. For Djedefre to have not enacted this ritual, for him to have not supported his father’s resurrection, would not have just been blasphemy, it would have been treason. To betray his father would have been to betray his obligations to the afterlife of his people. That’s not what happened. His father’s reliefs weren’t destroyed until hundreds of years later, and his participation in the funerary rites are evidenced by his creation of a\n\nIf there was a 4th Pyramid, it was made on the highest spot in Egypt by the first pharoah to call himself the son of God.\n\nHe was first to call himself son of Ra, which means he was the first to take his divinity to that level.\n\nThe fourth pyramid was known as the Starry Sky of Djedefre, who was the first Pharoah to insist on his identification as a solar deity. In some ways, this was a living out of his own name, Djed, the Egyptian ladder from earth to the heavens.\n\nThe builder of the great pyramid named his son after the Djed pillar, which, like the pyramid, represents an ascent to the top of reality. This son, Djedefre, is said to have then built on the highest mountain in Egypt. At the same time, he started calling himself the son of Ra. Like Eden and the tower of Babylon, the deconstruction of the fourth pyramid is the story of pride and fall. This is the time honored narrative of what happens to the man who tries to be a god.\n\nThe location of the fourth pyramid has primarily to do with the fact it’s been built on the area’s high point which was incredibly important to a Djedefre, who was named after the Djed pillar — a symbolic ladder between heaven and earth.\n\nThis is the story of radical wild modern stories being woven atop little known history. We love the story of a son rebelling against a father, and we see evidence in the destruction of the father’s monuments, but these monuments were actually destroyed hundreds of years later. We love the idea that Djedefre’s distant pyramid represents the sort of ostricization of the pharoah, but the location has more to do with the fact that this is the highest point in the area. For the Greeks, they saw the revolution of the young Zeus from Mt. Olympus against his titanic father on Mt. Etna, and in the exile of Djedefre to the tallest distant mountain they saw the exile of Prometheus. Through the eyes of the Jews, we see the fall of the tower of Babylon and the fall of Eden, where the attempts of Eve and Satan to elevate themselves to divine status was met by exile and destruction.\n\nPyramids had to do with the Pharoah ascending to the role of Sun God, not unlike the scene in which the resurrected Christ ascends to Heaven to become one with his father. This would have been a repetition of Amun rising atop the first mound of creation. Amun was Ra was Atum was…\n\nWar of the generations as war between mountains mimes the tension between the pyramids of the last pharoah and the new one. Here we see the myth of the warring mountains between generations.\n\nDirectly beneath the pyramid in Mexico City was a great cave associated with the afterlife, which is no different than the representation of an Egyptian underworld beneath the Pyramids.\n\nIn Mexico City, the pyramid of the moon was raised in the honor of the storm god, who had been associated with a mountain near the solar pyramid. If we were to look for a parallel, we might look to the fourth pyramid on the mountain nearby the solar pyramids as a pyramid associated with a storm deity. This would be consistent with the idea that this pyramid was black and at a distance, as black was associated with night and chaos, which was associated with the storm god Seth, a more shadowy pharoah associated with the moon when he takes the form of a boar with crescent tusks.\n\nThe rise of the pyramids coincided with a new emphasis on Re, as seen in the name of Djedef-Re, which means “Enduring like Re,” but djed doesn’t just mean enduring, it refers to the djed pillar climbed by Osiris to reach Re.

To build a pyramid was to build Osiris’ ladder to heaven—the Pharoah’s ladder to Ra.\n\nIf the pyramid complex at Giza is anything like other monuments and holy cities from around the world, the story of one pharoah independently deciding what to do with his pyramid doesn’t fit. Instead, it would be more like each Pharoah was participating in a multigenerational plan, and it seemed he may have drawn the short straw — it seems he was the one asked to make a pyramid that represented something different than the others, for which reason it was distanced and made dark.\n\nALIGNMENT: All over the world, monuments are modeled and aligned with the heavens — this has to do with the core spiritual or existential need to transcend the daily experience estrangement from everything else. We want to experience oneness with the heavens, with the earth, with humanity, with the divine and our lovers. The pyramids are fundamentally motivated by this desire to meet the heavens and become one with divinity. This is not an exercise in individualism. The prideful attempt of the individual to reach and declare oneself god is what results in the fall of Satan, Adam and the Tower of Babel. Islam, means submission. The way to become one with god is not to rebel, it is to make below as it is above — to model reality after the heavens, which is fundamental to all megaliths. So when the pharoahs start building pyramids and calling themselves the son of god, are we looking at a narrative of Hubris? Or is this a misunderstanding. Is it possible that the pyramids were built following a design inspired by the heavens? This would take us to the idea that the pyramids are actually inspired by Orion’s Belt, which would make sense, because Orion was known as Osiris to the Egyptians, and when the king died, they became Osiris. So it’s not just that we see the perfect alignment of the stars and their brightness, it’s that it’s the right constellation to be aligning. But then what of the fourth pyramid? Does it blow that theory? No, this would be an oversimplification of the sky to the stars. The sky also tells the story of storms, and if we look at the great pyramids of the americas, we see a clarifying parallel. Distant from the great pyramid of the sun, built atop a higher mountain, is the temple of the moon, which is dedicated to the storm god. Similarly, the fourth pyramid was built atop a higher mountain at a bit of a distance, and, it wasn’t made to shine like the sun. It was covered in dark materials. Could this have been a temple of moon or storm? And if so, why Djedefre? The answer may be in his name. The EF in Djedefre is symbolized by a horned serpent. With the american pyramids, it’s the horned serpent who brings wind and rain. The same is true in china, where their dragons are horned serpents who bring storms. For the Egyptians, storms were associated with the desert, where the horned serpents can be found — both were imagined at a safe distance from daily life. This is to say, the layout of Giza would match the layout of the great Mexican pyramids if we can recognize the dark-distant pyramid built as relating to storms. Not only would this be consistent with the way the Egyptians imagined the layout of their world, it is also supported by the appearance of the horned serpent in Djedefre’s name, which is associated with storms around the world and in other pyramid complexes."

However, this Pharaoh had fled south to Ethiopia, when Egypt had been invaded by the Persians in 343BC, so he never had the opportunity to occupy his tomb. The site of the prospective tomb was a chapel within the temple complex of the Serapeum in the cemetery area of ancient Memphis at Saqqara. The Serapeum complex was rediscovered by Auguste Mariette in 1850-1851. Guarding the entrance to the chapel of Nectanebo II, Mariette discovered an incongruous semicircle of life-size Greek statues of poets and philosophers. Some of them can be identified, including Pindar, whose house and descendants Alexander had saved at Thebes, Homer, who was Alexander's favourite poet, and Plato, who had been the mentor of Alexander's tutor, Aristotle.

Two years after Alexander's death, the body was actually supposed to be transferred to Macedonia. At that time, Ptolemy attacked the funeral procession and had the mummy brought to Memphis. So the tradition goes, but what if the dead body was brought home after all? One current archaeological find in Greece in particular have caused a stir in the past in this context. In 2014, experts discovered another burial mound in Greece. The complex with a circumference of 500 metres is located not far from the ancient city of Amphipolis. Amphipolis was an important city of the Macedonian Empire under Alexander the Great. This is one of the reasons why scientists speculate whether the tomb of Alexander, his mother Olympias or his wife Roxanne could be found in the complex.\n\nAt the same time Andrew Chugg has made a new suggestion regarding the current whereabouts of Alexander's corpse. Only one existing ancient, mummified corpse is known to have appeared in central Alexandria at the end of the 4th century AD, just when Christianity triumphed over the pagan religions in the city, and Alexander's body mysteriously disappeared. This was the set of human remains which was said by the Alexandrian church to be the corpse of St Mark the Evangelist, the founder of Christianity in Alexandria. It happens that this same corpse was subsequently taken from Alexandria after the city had fallen under Arab rule. In AD828 two merchant-captains smuggled the richly perfumed mummy past the Alexandrian port officials and sailed back with it to their native city of Venice. For centuries it lay in a tomb in the crypt beneath the church built to house it by the Venetians, the Basilica of St Mark. But instead of the saint's bones, the Venetians could have got hold of Alexander's mummy. After all, one embalmed person looks like another. Is it actually possible that traders at the time were smuggling into Venice not the mummy of St Mark, but that of Alexander the Great. The Macedonian king buried in Venice's St Mark's Basilica, hidden from the eyes of the world for centuries? Has Andrew Chugg solved the mystery? Is the tomb of the Macedonian ruler neither in Egypt nor in Greece? At least the Greeks would vehemently deny this theory. After all, Alexander's tomb is an important aspect of identity for them in terms of the country's national self-image."

Similarly, Alexandria’s leadership of the Alexandrian world had to do with the presence of Alexander’s tomb.

          "text": "There are several contenders for the divine source of Alexander’s conception. Firstly, we learn that his mother, Olympias, met Philip at a Kabeiroi ritual, which may have been an orgy, not unlike the orgies of Dionysus, who she is known to have worshipped.\n\nArthur, Hercules, , Christ, Alexander — according to myth, they were all conceived by a great father who came to their mother before she was known by her husband. It’s a major motif from myth that shows up in the story of Alexander.\n\nNectanebo was ousted by the Persians, who had been held at bay for a generation by the alliance of Egypt and Athens, but Athens had become weak, dwarfed by the power of Macedon. So when Alexander showed up to liberate Egypt from Persia with the help of their old friends in the Athenian army, it was as though they were liberated by old allies. According to the Ptolemys, this was no accident, as Alexander was in fact the son of Nectanebo, who seduced Olympias. This is consistent with the fact that she told Alexander he was the son of God, a quality of all pharoahs. It’s also consistent with the fact that when Alexander tried to find out of this was true, he asked the Egyptian oracle of Amun-Ra, which Olympias and the Greeks saw as Zeus.\n\nmotif. And in the case of Alexander,\n\nAlexander’s mother claimed he was the son of Zeus, and\n\nAlexander’s father claimed to have been a descendent of Hercules, son of Zeus, who came to his mother before the king. This is an ancient motif that can also be seen in the stories of Siegfried and Arthur, who\n\nThe conspiracies around the divinity of Alexander are many. The stories known to history are that Olympias told Alexander he was not Philip’s son but that he was actually the son of Zeus, for which reason he went to the oracle of Amun-Ra in Egypt, who was associated with Zeus by Alexander and the Greeks. Not only was he greeted as the son of God when he arrived, he also became a god when they elevated him to Pharoah of Egypt. Now where this gets really interesting is that, according to Ptolemy, the true father of Alexander was the exiled pharoah of Egypt, Nectanebo II, who would have presented himself as a God to Olympias, and who is depicted in art as a dragon, which aligns with a story of Philips in which he found her sleeping with a snake. If these stories are true, the source of Alexander’s divine blood is the same as his eventual recognition as God — Egypt and the line of pharaohs. The question is, who, if anyone, was telling the truth?"

This was a repetition of history, as the previous period of Egyptian freedom from Persia had come under the protection of Athens, which followed shortly after their defeat of Xerxes. Furthermore, a legend arose that he was actually the son of the last free Egyptian pharoah, nectanebo, which aligned his mother’s statement that he was the son of God after having been found sleeping with a dragon.

According to the legend, Alexander was a true Horus, a true son of the former pharoah returned to seek vengeance on his father’s betrayal.\n\nthe Greeks and Egyptians shared the Persians as a common enemy for centuries, so though the Persian rulers of Egypt were named Pharoahs, they were seen as tyrants and invaders, Alexander was seen as a liberator.\n\nPersians had conquered Egypt long before challenging Greece, and it wasn’t long after Athens led the defeat of Persia thst Egypt broke free and partnered with Athens on their defense.

When they returned, work began on what would become St. Mark’s Basilica, where the body remains.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the Egyptian tomb they raided is that it appeared in the center of Alexandria just after pagan monuments in were forcibly destroyed or repurposed for Christianity throughout the entirety of Rome — a time when the tomb of Alexander went missing from the center of Alexandria. The theory is then that the tomb of the city’s pagan patron was converted into a tomb for the city’s great Christian patron, St. Mark.\n\nChristians were minorities in Alexandria until 330 AD, and by 390, all signs of paganism were to be destroyed across Rome. Alexander’s tomb could have then suffered the same fate as so many other Pagan monuments. In some cases, however, pagan sites were converted into Christian churches, which could have been the case with the magnificent tomb of Alexander. And if it was the case, if Alexander’s monument was repurposed for Christianity in the late 4th century, it’s believed it could have been repurposed as the tomb of St. Mark.

Greeks associated her with Aphrodite and the Phoenicians with Astarte, all of which were seen in Venus. Like Cleopatra, these goddesses personified the epitome of feminine power.\n\nCleopatra personified the epitome of feminine power like all the goddesses of Venus.\n\nWhen Isis restores the first spark of life in the dead corpse of her husband Osiris, it’s concurrent with her own conception of his son Horus, which depends on the wooden penis she’s made to replace her husband. So when Cleopatra filled gords with bees for for her pleasure, she became an incarnation of Isis.\n\nLike the fairy that awakens Pinocchio with a spark from her magic wand, the first spark of Osiris’ resurrection is delivered by a wooden phallus invented by Isis. So when Cleopatra is credited for inventing the vibrator, everyone in Egypt saw Isis. This recurring motif of the wand and life-spark concerns the mystery of life itself, a secret kept by Isis in the quiet of her cosmic womb, the source of all life.\n\nMother of Divine Child:\n\nlike Isis, her goal was to bare a divine child that would lead a new world order, which is exactly what would have happened had she been able to clear a path for her son with Ceasar, Caesarian. Had she succeeded, her people would not have been subdued by an invading force, which they would have associated with Set. Instead, Egypt would have been a partner in Rome.\n\nPower over Ruler:\n\nAs Isis held power over Egypt by holding power over Ra, so did Cleopatra hold power over Rome.\n\nIn Alexandria, Isis was associated with Aphrodite, both of whom were seen in Venus. So when Cleopatra appears to Marc Antony as Aphrodite, she’s appearing as Venus in her most romantically erotic form.\n\nWhen Cleopatra appeared to Ceasar in a carpet, she appeared as the fabric of reality with which Isis was associated. When she appeared to Marc Antony as Isis-Aphrodite, she appeared in her most romantic and erotic form. This wasn’t just targeted seduction that recognized Antony as romantic and Ceasar as a man who wanted the world, for her, this would have been part of her magic.\n\nwho wanted to rule the world as the fabric of reality with which Isis was associated,\n\nAphrodite: Alexander’s conquest led to an era much like globalization. This led to an intellectual and religious period that emphasized comparisons and connections between gods from different regions. In Alexandrian Egypt, Isis was seen as Aphrodite, which is the form taken by Cleopatra when he appeared to Marc Antony. And what’s so important about this is that it shows us where Cleopatra gets her  into\n\nWhen Cleopatra appeared as Aphrodite to Marc Antony, it was not a departure from her role as Isis, who, for the Greeks, was associated with their goddess of love.\n\nTo appear in a carpet to Ceasar is to associate herself with the carpet, which is associated with the fabric of reality, which we see in the wings of Isis. In Latin, we see this connection in the word mater, which means both mother and matter, which are related to the word, matrix. The matrix of reality is the maternal fabric of reality. Everything in our reality is born from that matter of mothers — this is the maternal matrix of matter. This is the carpet in which Cleopatra appears. She is not just offering herself, she is offering the wings of Isis.\n\nThe association of carpet with a woman’s sexual organs isn’t just about hair, it’s about the fact that the fabric of living reality is woven by and from the wombs of mothers. All of us everywhere were born from mothers. Maternal Matrix, matter mother — these words point to an understanding of the maternal as the fabric of reality that wraps around us and holds us, this is what the wings of Isis are all about— these are the wings that wrap around us like a womb, like the wings of a chicken around her chicks. So when Cleopatra arrives in a carpet, it is a deeply symbolic gesture. She arrives offering so much more than her body — she’s offering the wings of Isis — arms in which the world’s greatest leader might truly rest. And he did.\n\nWhen a Pharoah died, he or even she, became Osiris, who was the Djed pillar. The Djed pillar was a ladder to heaven and model for the Pyramid, which we recognize as a tomb and monument to Osiris. But Cleopatra, didn’t identify as Osiris. She identified as Isis, which begs the question, could she have had herself buried in a tomb and monument to Isis? If so, it would have looked very similar to the way her family had created a tomb and monument for Alexander the Great, which served as a center for a cult that presented him as, like Osiris, the son of Egypt’s god.\n\nShe was quite familiar with the way Alexander’s tomb had become a religious center for his cult, which presented him as the son of Ra, like Osiris. If Cleopatra wanted the same for herself, she would have built a tomb to be a religious center for the cult of Isis."

Eventually, every one wanted to prepare themselves for that journey, but at an earlier time, the sun, ra, guided the Ba Soul of Osiris through the underworld. Osiris then becomes a guide to others through the underworld. This is called a psychopomp. A therapist or Shaman can be a psychopomp.

As Cleopatra holds sway over Caesar, it was Isis who knew Ra’s weakness.\n\nCleopatra and Isis\n\nKnows Weakness / Has Power Over/with Ra / Roman Emperor\n\nWe sometimes think of female leaders as having to play a man’s game. This was as true in ancient Egypt as it is in the modern world. Hetchepsut, for example, wore the goatee of Horus. She did this, because, in the myth, the new Pharoah is always Horus. This is why male pharaohs wore the goatee, to be Horus. Cleopatra was the rare female pharoah who didn’t play Horus. She played the Queen. She didn’t wear the pantsuit. No way. She was Isis and she knew it. Imagine president Beyoncé, imagine a woman as a head of state actually using her femininity. That was Isis. That was Cleopatra.\n\nCleopatra was not a repressed or secretive Christian monarch. She was a sexually empowered queen of Egypt — a woman in full force.

The Pharoah was a god on earth associated with the sun, a literal son of the sun god, of the father god, Ra. Though Egyptian religion is polytheistic in structure, it is also monotheistic in its hierarchy, which is why it was possible for Akhenaten to attempt monotheism. Any emperor after Ceasar must have thought about what it would have been like to have been Caesarian, to have been Horus the son of god and the emperor of Rome. This kind of alignment wasn’t achieved until Christianity was adopted, which draws heavily from Egypt. I’m not sure there would have been a Christian conversion had Cleopatra succeeded, which means no burning of Alexandria and no end of Paganism. But that couldn’t do, because the Egyptian and Roman religion, much as they can be fit together, are not perfectly compatible. I suppose they could try to make them, but they aren’t. Mother Earth and father earth, for example. No, tehre had to be one true accurate religion for people to really believe. History couldn’t go that way."

          "text": "Atilla’s army was defined by the advantages of archers on horseback, and there’s nothing that could stop a woman from learning this skill. A group of women on horseback with bows would be devastatingly dangerous on any ancient battlefield\n\nIn representations of divine feminine figures we often see a convergence of both the power to bring life into this world and the authority to take it away. Durga from India gives birth to men but also eats them—not unlike Ishtar, who would both mate with and destroy zgilgsmesh. When we confront a band of woman warriors, on one level, they can be seriously fierce fighters, and certainly with bows on horseback. On another level, they represent the power over life and death we often see in mythic women—from Durga and the Maenads to Ishtar and the Amazons.\n\nDiana or Artemis is not an Amazon in mythology, but, like the Amazons, she wields the bow. The bow represents aiming focus. Where the Dionysian Maenads enact the destructive force of feminine fury, their scariest quality is unthinking billigerance. Athena bares the gorgon on her shield to display her inner mastery of this feminine fury, and Artemis bares a bow—like the Amazons—to demonstrate the focus of this feminine ferocity into a single penetrating dart.\n\nSome Amazons bare the image oft he Gorgon on their shield—like Athena, another woman warrior. This represents the warrior woman’s ability to harness her inner Gorgon, which is a nightmarish interpretation of feminine vitality. Women can fight. And as with male Berzerker warriors like Hercules and Ajax, those woman warriors who can channel their inner rage and wildness into a disciplined fighting style are the most fearsome of all. This is what we see represented when we see the Gorgon on shield of Amazons and Athenians. It’s the same reason we see it on the shield of Zeus, whose Olympian order subdued the Titanic – it represents the ability to harness that more raw part of ourselves with inner discipline and intellect.\n\nWhat’s so precious about the image of Diana or Artemis, the huntress, is that her arrow represents the focusing of her ferocity. She carries the same energy as the Dionysian Maenads that can absolutely rip a man to shreds, but in the figures of Athena, Artemis and the Amazons, we see women capable of focusing and aiming this feminine ferocity.\n\nZeus, whose Olympian order has subdued the Titanic, also bares the Gorgon on his shied. Throughout Greek myth, one of the key themes is the focusing of raw psychological energies into characters like Athena and Zeus definied by the strength of their minds."

This is because—from Pandora to Eve—there’s an association of mother with matter. In Latin, they share the same word—Mater—and from Christianity to the philosophy of Socrates, there is a belief that matter and embodiment is a prison that corrupts consciousness. This hasn’t just led to the repression of qualities identified as feminine, it’s led to the objectification and oppression of real women in our real world. The subduing of bodily sin has been indistinguishable from the suppressing of females and femininity—from Ancient Greece to modern day. This subduing takes the form of myths in which women are subdued or defeated by men—the Gorgon is a perfect example, because we also see the Gorgon on Amazonian shields."

In Greek Mythology we see this contrast between Athena and the Gorgon on her shield. On a group level, we see it in the disparity between Amazons and Maenads. Where the frenzy of a Maenad represents unbound and unthinking instinct and urges, the discipline of Amazon archers represent the potential to focus that destructive potency into a single aimed shot. This is what Diana or Artemis represents—she is as wild and potent as nature itself, but she’s not without thought or focus. As Athena is to the Gorgons, the Amazons are to the Maenads—powerful masters of the feminine vitality."

That there are men with fantasies of dominant women would have been as true in Ancient Greece as is it on Wall Street.\n\nHeroes and Amazons fall in love with one another on the battlefield once one has bested the other in a very close struggle. On one level this might be a memory of a very real mating ritual in which indo-european war bands set out in search of women. On another level, lovers continue to look for their “match” – and I’m not sure love is ever free of power. In this way we might see the fight between male and female warriors as a poetic expression of love—and lust.\n\nWomen were treated so unequally in ancient Athens that a peer-to-peer relationship was unthinkable enough for men to only know peer-to-peer romance as existing between men. In a society like that, the male wish for a peer might look like a fantasy tale in which warrior women were found on an adventure.\n\nRomantically, you might say we are looking for our match—someone that challenges us, you might say.\n\nPsyche doubts cupid until he’s beneath her knife, at which point her love becomes unshakable. Hercules similarly falls in love with an Amazon queen at the moment he’s killed her. These are poetic expressions of a common experience in love,\n\nMyths tend to have erotic implications, and that of the Amazons is no different.\n\nOne of the memories echoing through Amazon mythology seems to be a forgotten mating or matching ritual in which Indo-European war bands selected their women in ways that resulted in onlythe strongest women becoming their wives.\n\nWhat are the sources that tell us about the Amazon myth (vases, \"the comics of antiquity\")\n\nMany of our sources on Amazons come from vases, which were popular for Symposia in which men gathered to drink wine. Though I know men would never objectify fantasy women while getting together for drinks in the 2020’s, this may have happened from time to time in ancient Greece."

Gorgons and maenads represent a feminine fury that can rip men to shreds and turn them to stone. When the Gorgon appears on Athena’s shield, it doesn’t represent the her lack of Gorgon energy, it represents how she’s mastered it and put it to use as a defender. This is the mastery we see in Artemis’ arrow. She is as wild and potent as any Maenad, but she’s also able to focus that feminine potency into a highly aimed attack. So when we see an Amazon carrying the shield of Athena and a bow like Artemis, we see them as women who have mastered and focused their own inner vitality."

To displace the crescent breast with the crescent bow is a poetic statement that these women are not in the business of nursing life into existence, they’re reapers of death. There is no evidence of any literal truth when it comes to the sheering of their breasts.\n\nThe cutting off of the breast seems to represent a choice having been made between motherhood and war fighting, and it may even represent the author’s sense of their archetypal incompatibility. The breast nurses life into this world, the arrow kills.\n\nMyths are often better seen as questions than answers. If a myth says it’s set in the Caucasus mountains, then we should go looking in the Caucasus mountains. Sometimes we’ll find something and sometimes we’ll find out that even the specific geography was meant as mere poetry. The truth myths are trying to get at is not limited to the literal or the historical, but that’s not to say storytellers haven’t been highly interested in cataloguing history. Myths don’t delineate philosophical, psychological or literal truth, in fact, they emerge exactly where there’s overlap. Where historical truth mimes a philosophical truth mimes a psychological truth – that’s going to trigger myths and dreams.\n\nThe crescent shape of the bow, breast and moon has led to their association.\n\nThere are pictures of Amazons from the Greek period that show women with both breasts, and we aim from our eye, not from our chest.\n\nIn Sarcacian, the name for forest and moon were similar, and so you see this moon like forest mother.

And in the myths, body and materiality are presented as prisons for a fallen consciousness. They’re also seen as the sources of pleasure, emotion and thereby the corruption of spirit by sin. This philosophical enmity between spirit and matter has become a mythic enmity between masculinity and femininity has become real enmity between men and women.\n\nThe male quest for a woman—or even the grail—is, one one level, a poetic expression of male consciousness trying to integrate the femininity it’s split off from itself. At its worst this is a journey in which femininity is subdued. At its best, these are journeys in which men do things they’ve repressed as feminine and materialistic—this can look like developing a relationship with the body and nature. It can look like the opening of the heart and the integration of an emotional reality. It always includes the death of a hypermasculinized ego.\n\nWomen are mythically associated with the material vessel of life, whether that’s the pregnant mother or mother earth. Unfortunately, Western philosophy and religion has been defined by its recognition of materiality and earthly existence as a prison into which we’ve fallen that corrupts our spiritual purity. Because women are mythic personifications of materiality, the spiritual and philosophical attack on matter has become a social and political attack on mothers. In Latin, mother and matter share a word – mater – and so the anger and blame pointed at Eve and Pandora is anger at the material world for imprisoning and corrupting the soul. This is how we thank our mothers for bringing us into this world.\n\nWomen have been historically and mythically conflated with matter,"

In Artemis we see shades of the Egyptian Nepthys, a ferocious huntress of the Egyptians who appears as the second woman in a dynamic with Osiris and Isis—not unlike the inspiration of Wonder Woman, who became the third in a relationship between the creator of Wonder Woman and his wife.\n\nDiana or Artemis is not an Amazon in mythology, but, like the Amazons, she wields the bow. The bow represents aiming focus. Where the Dionysian Maenads enact the destructive force of feminine fury, their scariest quality is unthinking billigerance. Athena bares the gorgon on her shield to display her inner mastery of this feminine fury, and Artemis bares a bow—like the Amazons—to demonstrate the focus of this feminine ferocity into a single penetrating dart."

He was an early feminist who worked on the lie detector and believed in solving problems with love instead of war.\n\nIn one of the most meaningful scenes in recent memory we see Diana emerge from the trenches to stare down the full fury of the Nazi army, and in that moment we see the rising of repressed feminine vitality against the very worst of our world’s hypermasculine toxicity."

          "question": "Where does the myth of the amazons come from?",
          "text": "Amazon Myths are a conglomeration of several things, They represent a memory of what may have been a more matriarchal period in human history. Their battles with men may capture memories of an ancient mating ritual. They are certainly shadow figures for oppressed athenian wives and fantasy figures for athenian men. Beneath all of this, they may be a real historical group of fighting women that doesn’t deserve but might actually appreciate their emergence as poetic representitives of repressed ferocity and feminine focus.\n\nA memory of matriarchy\n\nA memory of a mating ritual – there is a story of Hercules falling in love with the woman he defeats and another story of an Amazon woman falling in love with a man she has defeated. In some way the myths look like a mating ritual or contest in which we are looking for our match.\n\nA shadow of athenian wives\n\nReal women warriors who sometimes don’t deserve all the extra projection\n\nA repressed dimension of what the feminine represented symbolically and mytholgically as matter – we see matter as dead and inhabited by life, but that’s a repression of a shadow reality that the material and feminine is alive.\n\nFemale Berzerker mode\n\nRecent discoveries have shown that many ancient Amazonian names are Abkhazian, Ubek and Ossetian. To this day, these people tell stories of legendary figures called Narts, and among these Narts is a figure names Amazan, a woman warrior who leads a band of women who live in the forest. The location of these Forests in the area of the Black Sea is consistent with the mythic memory of the Amazons in this region.\n\nAmazan – woman warrior leads a band of women warriors who lives in the forest, she’s called Amazan because it means little golden knees, because her boots and trousers don’t quite meet, so she is sun tanned between them. This is a motif in the culture – other characters are held on their thigh when dipped in water and that is their one weakness.\n\nFeminine Ferocity Continued\n\nOn one hand, Amazons represent the powerful destructive force we see in those maenadic women who rip men to shreds, and on another, they represent the focusing of this ferocity into the discipline of a warrior. This is seen in the bow, which focuses aggression into a pointed shot, and it’s also seen in the Aegis, which they sometimes share with Athena. This shield, which bares the image of a gorgon, is consistent with the personality of Athena. While there’s no warrior more feared, there’s also no warrior more thoughtful or focused. She and Artemis, like the Amazons, represent women who have learned to channel and focus their inner fury. This is the same fury we see in Hercules and Ajax when their Berzerker energy is aimed at friends and family. Over and again in Greek Mythology we see this focus on mastering our inner titanism.\n\nMother and Matter Continued\n\nFrom Pandora to Eve we’ve seen the mythological alignment of the mother with the material. In Latin they share a word, mater. In contrast, Pater gives us the words for both pattern and father. This is to say, the duality of male and female has been mythologized as a tension between matter, which is seen as inanimate, and pattern, which is associated with fire and consciousness. This sets up an understanding of materiality and femininity as a prison that corrupts our minds or souls. Unfortunately, what’s really corrupted is our culture’s relationship with both women and its understanding of femininity. The oppression of the feminine is co-emergent with the association of femininity with materiality and emodiment, sense perception and biological urges. These aren’t just seen as sin in Christianity. Socrates presents the same understanding of body as a prison that corrupts our souls with urges we must learn to silence. The silencing of the inner feminine has coincided with the silencing of women.\n\nOnce we recognize this backdrop, we start to see mythic warrior women as both older than this worldview and as an exact response thereto. Where Pandora represents a woman made by a man – a woman whose mater is inanimate before fire is added—older figures like the Gorgons and Maenads represent an vision of the feminine as overwhelmingly powerful and certainly animated. In these figures we see feminine fury that can shred men and turn them to stone. When Greek heroes confront these forces, we might see it as an effort to repress or deny the reality of the feminine. While the fantasy is that matter is inert, it is actually animated. The feminine is not dead matter to be animated by the masculine. The moon is more than a reflector of the sun. In the myth, the Gorgon is subdued, but in reality, it’s the Gorgon that haunts us.\n\nThis is something I talked about in the documentary on Alien. We think we’re in a gargantuan universe of dead matter, but when we get deep in space to mine that matter, we find that the mater is alive, it’s a mother, and it’s going to haunt us until we see a new ideal, represented by Ripley, who champions female values from within a patriarchically structured crew. The alien is like the Gorgon and Ripley is like Athena. Where the Gorgon and the Alien represent the potency of femininity at its scariest, Athena and Ripley represent that same energy in its most victorious state. We see the same thing in Artemis. She represents all of that Maenadic energy—a blur of life giving power with unbound emotional energy—brought into the focus of a single arrow. This is the Amazons. They are the women able to channel the raw energy of a Maenad or Gorgon through the discipline of a warrior and with the aimed focus of an archer.\n\nOn one hand, we have Matrix, Meter and the Egyptian Maat thst point towards the the order and patterns of our materiality, on the other side we have Mater, which means both mother and matter."

At the same time, the Christian church and priesthood, like the Jewish patriarchy of Christ’s time, is a pillar of conservatism. Religious organizations always are. And so the change bringing love of Christ is preserved by a conservative institution who’s stability has been a cornerstone of stability for Europe and beyond. Institutions have come and gone in the last two thousand years. The Catholic Church has not.\n\nA culture is stabilized by its conservatism and expanded by its newness. In the western civilization and Christianity, the church has served the conservative function of a stabilizing pillar that anchored a huge range of disparate identities.\n\nScientists tend to be reductive, for which reason the diversity of narratives about Pope Joan are taken as evidence of their fallacy. But in a world overrun with comparable cancellations, we have to ask ourselves, even when there’s an objective truth, do we not end up with countless competing narratives?\n\nTo dismiss a historical origin of a myth based on the existence of another historical origin is to be blinded by the linear reductionism of an overly masculine mind. Arthur, Hercules, you name it – good myths are almost always informed by more than one historical figure.\n\nThere’s a rumor that Pope Joan was actually a form of bullying or critical satire towards Pope John VIII, who was seen as weak when dealing with his enemies and ridiculed as feminine behind his back.\n\nHistory or not, there is a story of Pope Joan, and the question of whether or not she’s historical is consistent with that story. This is the story of women’s oppression, suppression and repression—from church, state and history itself. And notice, in stories about women dressing as men, they aren’t just stories about how women are forced to conform to masculine ideals in a masculine culture, they’re also about how they are forced to conceal their femininity. She doesn’t just have to hide her body, she hides her pregnancy—she hides the very expression of her most divine creative energy. And what else is suppressed? The sexual scandal—the same scandal of Adam and Eve, who’s original sin is to disobey the divine patriarchy by having sex and making babies. The demonization of Pope Joan is a repetition of hatred for Eve, and what that hatred represents is an anger at having fallen. This is the fall of spirit into matter. Matter isn’t just seen as a prison that corrupts the soul, it’s also the word for Mother. Eve and Pandora don’t just represent the mother, they represent materiality. And so whether it’s Greek Orphism, Platonic Philosophy, Ascetic Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity or Islam, there’s a mythical alignment of the material and the maternal. As matter and body are seen as corrupting prisons of falling consciousness, the mother is a representative of the fall and a personification of corruption with a seductive body. Pope Joan may be historic. She’s also a perfect mythic repetition of Eve. And for the same reasons, she became associated with the Whore of Babylon.\n\nWomen heroes are often more than representative of women, they can also be representatives of femininity. The success of a woman can be a story about the value of femininity. These stories can be written in response to a climate that devalues qualities that have been identified as feminine.\n\nAnd once we start talking about the oppression of women, we have to start talking about the collective repression of what we associate with femininity.\n\nNotice that both Zeus and Jehovah or Yahweh are presented as procreators – makers of people. In reality, this is something mothers do, and Goddesses have been worshiped as divine creators for as long as we can remember. With the rise of Zeus and Jehovah we see a mythological degradation of femininity. Pandora and Eve are blamed for all humanity’s problems and the two Patriarchs claim the creative power of a woman. In Pope Joan, we see the mythic tension between Patriarchal power and the reality that it’s the Matriarchs who bring life into this world.\n\nI can’t help but see the story as something like Mythic graffiti, to paint a mother giving birth into a Pope in a procession is like subversive joke that pokes fun at a self-important Patriarchy in complete denial about where the real power of creation comes from.\n\nShe is an Athena or Hermione like figure – a brilliant thinker who excels in the scholastic environment."

Could the story of Attila’s grave have been based on similar religious beliefs? Or could this be just one of several mythic threads in his burial designed to elevate his memory",
          "text": "According to the story, the Nibelung treasure was lost to its unknown location in the Rhine when Kriemhild and/or her husband, Atilla, killed those who knew its location.\n\nAttila died of a “hemorrhage”. What could that mean?The Huns were a warrior culture—especially under Attila. Warrior ideals—from Achilles to the Samurai—is to die a warrior’s death. At the same time, everyone wants someone or something to blame. So when Ildico was found cowering next to the dead Attila, there were multiple motivations for assuming her guilt.  What we know is that he bled from his nose. Whether he choked on his blood or died from a hemmorage, the real question is if he was poisoned or just too drunk to sleep safely?\n\nIn the Edda’s, Atli’s death is caused by his wife, which is true to history; but in the Edda’s, motifs that can be identified with older myths are introduced. We first think of Medea, a witch of the Caucasus who, like Guorun, killed the chilren she bore to Jason. And like Georun, who sent the hair of a wolf to Gunnarr, Medea’s witchcraft, which she learned from Hekate, was associated with the wolf. This is an old indo-european association of the mother and dog that can be seen in Satanaya as well as the wolf who suckled Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhy were the undertakers killed?The secular answer is that the slaves who dug his grave were killed to bury its secret location. The religious answer might be more comparable to the not-uncommon practice of the dead monarch’s desire to have slaves in his afterlife. Both could be true, and both would be consistent with the burial of various Chinese emperors. The Hindu ritual, which is perpetuated by some still today, the good wife of a dead husband will throw herself on his pyre; otherwise, they would not be together in the afterlife.\n\nWhat is the triple coffin of gold, silver and iron that Attila is said to have been buried in?I am intrested in this reference but could not find: Another myth and also a modern translation error. In reality it is a triple thickening decorated with different metals; this actually occurs in some graves of the Asian Huns from this period.\n\nThe Egyptians and Ancient Hindus, among others, buried the dead in sheaths. This is related to the notion of body as a sheath for the soul. In Christianity, this motif can be seen in the comparison of the soul’s separation from body with wheat’s separation from chaff."

          "question": "Why are lost tombs like Attila's always the subject of myths?",
          "text": "Arthur & Attila, great leaders of their people, were lost upon death. According to the Arthurian tradition, he was taken to the isle of apples, “Avalon,” from which the King will Return. So on one level, the lack of a grave or body permits the fantasy of return or resurrection among their followers.\n\nGreat kings are typically buried with great treasure, for which reason the lost grave of a King becomes a myth of lost treasure.\n\nKing Tut’s grave was of course found after more than three thousand years.\n\nTombs are fertile ground for myths of the underworld, no pun intended. For example, the sword of Odin was withdrawn from a central tree in Valhalla—like Excalibur from the stone. Well, if you look at Indo-European Kurgans or burial mounds, what you find is a central pillar on which the old father’s sword will hang. So what we see is an image of Valhalla that relates to a much earlier burial practice.\n\nHow are the Huns and Attila perceived today?The longer and harder you hold something down, the more violently it will surface. This happened to the Romans in the form of Hun and Visigoth raids. Both were symptomatic of the same oppression, but where the Visigoths seem more like rebels seeking rights, the Huns seem more like terrorists seeking revenge. Given all the shooters and terrorists in our world, this is something we should all be thinking about. Oppression leads to terrorism and rebellion. Or rather, terrorism and rebellion is a response to oppression—real or perceived. The question is then if we should be focused on Attila as the destroyer of civilization or as its Shadow incarnate?\n\nWhat myth about the former royal city of Buda still exists in Hungary today?People in Hungary still perpetuate the myth of a lost Hun capitol in the Pilis Mountains—Buda to the Huns or Ösbuda, as it is called in Hungarian. Though archeologists have never found the city, many Hungarians believe in its existence. Some are committed to its discovery.\n\nHow were the different legend traditions mixed up? How did Attila become King Etzel of the Nibelungenlied?Attila, Atli, Etzel – these are likely just the translations of his name—little father—into different languages and dialects. Notice, by the way, that his name shares a prefix with Atlas, an Indo-European war-leader of the Titans. Insofar as the Romans sided with Olympus, you might say that the Titans—and all the raw drives they represented—finally won.\n\nFathers Eating Children: The scene of Atila eating his children in the Nibelung, intentional or not, aligns him with the mythic figure of the devouring father—most famously in Cronus, who ate his children to resist their power and retain his own. The devouring of the son is the ultimate expression of the patriarchal tyrant that hoards power. By adding a mythic layer in which Atila ate his children, he was aligned with the most evil tyrannical behavior in Indo-European memory.\n\nWhat was the \"concept\" of the equestrian people in battle?The real advantage of the Huns was their mounted archer – a motif that goes back to the centaur, which was likely inspired by the Hun’s Indo-European ancestors. If the stories are to be believed, they were so fluid on their horses, it might as well have been part of their body. At the same time, their swift maneuvering also reduced the efficacy of opposing archers. Have you ever seen a sports match where one team is just faster than the others? That was the Huns, running plays and running circles around their enemies.\n\nWhile some believed they didn’t wear armor, that doesn’t seem to be the case, though there are many accounts of sleeveless armor, which would have been more conducive to their focus on archery. What armor they did wear was lamellar or scale armor—an older form of armor that they have seen as traditional.\n\nThe Indo-Europeans were among the first true equestrian cultures, which were nomadic and typically had two leaders. This can be seen in Hengist and Horsa, who threatened Arthur, as well as Attila and Blada. When you see a double headed horse on the top of a barn, that’s what you’re looking at. That having been said, the pattern can be seen in both Romulus & Remus as well as the the Dioskuri, who are not particularly associated with horses. What’s going on is that an earlier horse culture entered the sea, which has to do with why the sea god, Poseidon, was also associated with horses. This is also why Trojan and Roman helmets are modeled after the horse. Though early indo-europeans were horse riders, not all waves of their migration retained such an equine focus. It’s also the case that some who did, particularly those in the Caucasus, who seem to be most comparable with the original Indo-Europeans, armored their horses heavily. These heavy-armored horse riders became prototypes for knights. Like the Huns, the people of the Caucasus are all but glued to their horses; so what led to the difference in their approach? Like the Narts, they were known for their bravery and battle cries.\n\nWhy were the Huns so feared?We always fear what we don’t understand—especially when it can sneak up on you so quickly and wants you dead. Not only were the Huns somewhat foreign and beyond understanding; their mobility on horses and their prowess as archers must have had everyone everywhere on edge. This is a people that left wakes of carnage and intentionally spread fear, a people that cut themselves to morn and faced battle fearlessly. It would have been incredibly hard to look at the threat they represented and find something in yourself that could have matched it.\n\nWhy were the arrows of the Huns considered magical?The Huns were spectacular mounted archers—something beyond the skill of Roman militaries. Because anything someone can’t do or understand becomes quickly associated with magic, and considering that Generals like Attila were seen as supernatural until their first loss, the Hun arrows of mounted archers, which could sneak up and kill you at a distance, would have been seen as almost magical\n\nSword of Mars – Atilla is said to have possessed the sword of Mars, or a more native war god. It was given to him by a Shepherd who found it in the grass. Symbolically, this may be a memory of the Shepherd as the ancient patron of the pastoral indo europeans and a recognition of the sword as a harvester of souls, as represented by its discovery in grass.\n\nThe sword of mars is not unlike the sword of Sigfried, Charlemagne or Arthur – all of which represented great might."

That England is more receptive to the possibility of ghosts than Germans should come as no surprise.\n\nOne of the reasons Germans are less receptive to ghosts than Brits probably has to do with Martin Luther’s perception of ghosts as a “Catholic Supersition,” or, could Luther’s perspective have been emergent from an already typical Germanic realism? If so, could this have to do with all the Papal inquisitions against non-conformists that happened in Germany but not England? Plenty of inquisitions happened in Spain, and they are more receptive to ghosts, but they were led by Catholics, who believe in ghosts. So can it be as simple as the history of German religion?

All innovation is against the bondage of some status quo—labor and disease, life on this planet. This is why Prometheus, the innovator, is always wrestling with chains. Technologies—from weapons to cures—rebel against the possible. But by rebelling against mortality—the human condition itself—Frankenstein crossed the ultimate boundary.\n\nSometimes science needs to be daring and explore new territories in order to fight against deadly diseases or improve life quality. To that end it has to at least push boundaries but at the same time keep an eye on ethical and moral values.\n\nFrankenstein, the modern day Prometheus, like Prometheus the titan, wrestles limitation itself. The fire he brings isn’t just the conscious vitality that animates his creatures, it’s the technologies that enable revolution—revolutions against the status quo. It is the archetypal nature of Promethean creators to challenge the limitations of their own creators—a pattern repeated by Frankenstein and the monster.\n\nThe status quo of nature, society and the mortal condition become the aims of\n\n(2.)

          "text": "One of the most famous episodes about Robin is his death - killed by his kinswoman, the Prioress of Kirklees Abbey. The abbey did exist and the old gatehouse is actually still there. We even find Robin Hood’s grave nearby - claiming that one „Robert Earl of Huntington“ was the true man behind the legend, dying 1247. But the site cannot be authentic: the style of the grave is Victorian age, the latin dating on the tombstone is clearly wrong and it is too far away from the priory to fit to the story. Scientists today know: the whole story of „Huntington being Robin Hood“ is based on a theatre piece from 1598 and a fake biography written by Martin Parker. The epitaph on the stone in Kirklees is even exactly the same as in the play.\n\nWe use this story as an example to show why finding the „real Robin“ is so difficult - for centuries people that loved him have tried to give him a place in history, faking graves and biographies. So we focus on key elements of story: he’s an outlaw, a bowman and his enemy is the Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\nOne historical figure that fought the Normans was „Hereward the Wake“. English Literature Professor Helen Philipps acknowledges that both Hereward & Robin belong to a long tradition of Outlaw figures but there are no proofs for Hereward being the real Robin. The early ballads never put Robin in any period at all. Also figures like Richard I, King John do not appear in the early texts. And above all: theres no one original narrative like Homer’s Iliad - we have many different ballads and legends. Our modern image of Robin is rather that of Walter Scott’s Novel „Ivanhoe“ (1820).\n\nWhat the oldest stories have in common is the fact that Robin was a low class „yeoman“ and a skilled archer. German bow-master Jürgen Junkmanns shows us how very deadly and accurate this simple weapon was. Engineers of TU Aachen also show that the famous „Robin Hood Shot“ - pinpointing another arrow - is very difficult and even though it is possible - clearly a fictional part of the legend.\n\nAnother central element in all stories is the Sheriff of Nottingham and the forest. In Nottingham we find authentic places of the stories, like St. Mary’s church and many inspiring dungeons.\n\nHistorian Dr. Sean McGlynn finally takes us with him on his approach of finding a real Robin. In the Chronicles of King Henry III he does find a person that fits nearly all the criteria for a real Robin: an outlaw and a bowman fighting with his men in a wood who becomes a hero in lifetime: a man called William of Kensham. Looking for his traces in southern England McGlynn finds an important historic event: the second French occupation in 1216. Fighting guerrilla style William and his men helped to defend Dover Castle and to defeat the French.\n\nEven though Robin Hood is very likely to be a composite figure that has been influenced by literature and fantasy throughout the ages, it is very possible that real persons like William of Kensham or places like Nottingham have inspired the original story.\n\nQUESTIONS: (Will Linn) (Often several questions can be answered together)"

Without the bow, we see the same light hearted romantic revolutionary fighting back against an English tyrant.\n\nThis is a mythic structure we remember from Prometheus and the birth of Athenian Democracy, and we see it in the American Revolution. One might even say that Robin Hood is the prototype for the story of the American Revolution, and by extension, the American Dream.\n\nLike the American Revolution, Robin Hood leads a rebellion of behalf of the overtaxed against a tyrannical monarch of England. Both result in a just government, and where Robin Hood has become conflated with the Magna Carta’s origin story, the American Revolution gave birth to modern democracy.\n\nThere’s a Robin figure in David Lowrey’s film on the Green Knight that recalls Robin’s more sinister side.

When we find ourselves wanting to love sympathetic villains, it’s because we want to be sympathetic to a part of ourselves from which we’ve been split off.

And as the story oft he American Revolution has inspired countless comparable histories, we have to wonder if it could have come from English rebels who’d never heard of Robin Hood.\n\nOn one level, the story of the bowman attacking the king’s vessel as it journeys through the forest is the scene of the moon attacking sun as it journeys through night. The story of sun and moon chasing one another through day and night recurrs all over the world, and the journey of the sun through night is always associated with peril and death. We think of attacks on Osiris as he journeys through the underworld on his solar boat.\n\nThe conflict of sun and moon is a conflict defined by the sun’s tyrannical dominance and the moon’s mysterious ways. Where the solar king is linear, power driven and direct, Robin is associated with music, wine, romance and the forest. He takes no offense when losing a fight to little john as a king would. What we’re seeing is a counterbalance or healing response to an overly solar, masculine and power driven psyche with the levity of Robin’s jokster heart, with music, with wine, with the dark mystery of the forest and an understanding of those people oppressed towards the darker spaces. He is a personfiication of what the king is not, and their disparity matches that of the sun and moon.\n\nThough the first Robin Hoods were likely more bad than good, because the archetypal essence of the story is one of a good hero vs. a bad villain, we’ve seen the narrative chyristalize in this direction over time. By now, Robin Hood has become an exemplary moral figure.\n\nThe myth of Robin Hood has been assembling and reassembling itself with all the best pieces – some of them historical, some of them mythological—all building an archetypal narrative around a few clear ideals: Good guy vs. Bad Guy, so despite the fact that the earliest Robin Hoods may have actually been more bad than good, we’ve seen the character evolve into good guy bandit.\n\nRobin Hood is the prototype for the American Revolution and by extension the American Dream.

What I become curious about is how many Black American Christians might take interest in Voudoun, an American born Black tradition that draws from African roots—if it wasn’t so demonized. And at the same time, I wonder how the demonization of this black tradition serves to reinforce racism.

Are we just thinking about a literal zombie apocalypse, or do we project our fear of over-population onto populations we other, shadow and demonize? FUndamentally,c the zombies are the many and the few escapees are the few. This, in some ways, is representative of the 1% in relation to the global population. So many zombie movies are about making it to the final encampment of well organized consciousness and governance, typically run by militaries with a white, christian and european lineages. Upper classes have always associated themselves with a higher caste and often with the head or crown, and they have often seen the masses as the body. The Zombie conflict is one of the head against the body, the many against the few."

It’s that they divide their understanding of the soul into two elements, one that relates to our personality and free will, and another that basically somewhat autonomously operates our body and its needs. This comes from areas in Africa within the Egyptian sphere of influence, and in Egypt, the mummy us seen as reanimated by Ka, the life-energy that animates our bodies.

In the Zombie we see the objectification of humans become spirit killing enslavement that results in mass uprisings. Mobs. And so they appear as a warning, if not a threat—objectify others at your own risk.\n\nWestern science and Christianity share the belief that matter is dead. For the Christians, matter is inhabited by spirit, and this is what\n\nOn one level, we can see a historical entry of the current zombie mythology through the enslavement of Africans in Haiti, where there is a local belief in zombies and from which our stories of zombies first emerged.\n\nOn another level, the image of zombies finally embraced by global culture includes a current of cannibalism inspired by vampire lore that doesn’t occur with the Haitian Zombie. Where did this come from? Why was it embraced? If the Zombie is Haitian and has to do with slavery, why does it’s wildly popular form include cannibalism?\n\nTwo parts of Soul\n\nIn some ways, the Zombie was impossible within the Christian tradition, which does not split the soul in two, like the Egyptian and Voudoun traditions. It’s only because they saw one part of the soul as the energy that moves the body and another as the personality that they could imagine a Zombie. For a Christian, if there’s enough soul to move the body, it’s not without consciousness or free will.\n\nSlavery – African American Historical Origins and amplifications into historical and modern examples of slavery, including media zombies\n\nCannibalism – Consuming Consumers\n\nMind vs. Body – Free Will vs. Bodily Drives\n\nFree Will vs. Automation & Authority – witch doctor, slave driver, hypnotist, puppeteer, robot maker, illuminati\n\nShadow – Demonized Projection of Repressed\n\nRaised Dead – Resurrection of Christ, Vampires, Mummies, Frankenstein\n\nZombies as voters\n\nBy now, what we know as the Zombie is a synthesis of sources from around the world and throughout the human experience.\n\nHAITIAN HISTORY: On one level, we can see a historical entry of the current zombie mythology through the enslavement of Africans in Haiti, where there is a local belief in zombies and from which our stories of zombies first emerged.\n\nARCHETYPAL On another level, the image of zombies finally embraced by global culture includes a current of cannibalism inspired by vampire lore that doesn’t occur with the Haitian Zombie. Where did this come from? Why was it embraced? If the Zombie is Haitian and has to do with slavery, why does it’s wildly popular form include cannibalism?\n\nCANNIBALISM: Once cannibalism was added to the Zombie image, it was embraced, because the synergy of the zombie and cannibal reaches a deep psychological understanding of the body as that which needs to consume. The body consumes. If you think the mind or soul is something different than the body, then you see the body as the part of you that eats to live. This is to say, the mindless body of the zombie only becomes a better expression of our understanding of body by becoming a representation of our drive to consume.\n\nBODY VS. CONSCIOUSNESS: This becomes an especially powerful archetypal configuration through the connection of consumption with enslavement. To what are we enslaved? The body and its need to consume in its effort to avoid its death. This is specifically about the death of body, as we recognize an absence of soul when there is an absence of free will, when we are zombies.\n\nFREE WILL: This is to say, the solution to zombification and enslavement is the arrival of soul, consciousness or free will. This is why the standard arc of heroes breaking old patterns to become new people is so pronounced in zombie movies.  From this way of understanding the zombie, brains are consumed as symbols of consciousness, which is eroded and finally killed by zombification.  Thus zombification imagery has extended into the masses marching on cell phones without thinking, mindlessly moving through their day. Through this current of zombification we see the Haitian witch controlling the zombies and its correlate in the slave master become the propaganda puppet masters that control us through media. Repeating the pattern, the zombie’s consumption becomes the consumption of media, and as they consume the media, they consume their own brains, foregoing their own consciousness for behavior encoded by our media landscape.  Recognizing the connection between enslavement and hypnosis, Get Out and Us present a vision of the world as puppeted and hypnotized by public narratives like Hands Across America.\n\nSHADOW: One of the things these stories help clarify is the way we repress and ignore the truth of our own self permitted zombification that results from our various drives to consume. This makes zombies shadow figures and monsters. But notice, it also makes slaves into shadow figures, which results in the demonization of the slave. This psychological demonization of the slave connects with the demonization of the mythological zombie image until all the inner demonization of the slave and enslavement is projected into the zombie. In Us, we see that the stories through which we are hypnotized result in shadows, which get locked away. He is unwavering in his presentation of black people and their history of enslavement as entangled by the repressed shadow of the larger culture in which they live.\n\nRAISED DEAD: Ready for import into the global image of the zombie are all the examples of raised dead throughout world religion and literature, from the resurrection of Christ and vampires to mummies and Frankenstein.\n\nHUMAN ROBOTS: And as the image evolved, it merged with a current of scientific thought that was strong in the collective imagination at the time of the Zombie’s initial arrival on the main stage.

This motivation is recognized as that which drives the mob.\n\nFREE WILL ARC: In Zombieland and in Shaun of the Dead, we see characters stuck in their own routines, stuck in their own Zombification, which they have to transcend.  The arc of heroes in zombie movies is the transcendence of their own routines. Shaun has to get beyond the bar and the protagonist in Zombieland has to finally break one of his rules to be a hero. We are all slaves to ourselves, and we project our own self enslavement onto every historical and fictional example. Remember to see movies as the dream of a dreamer. What is a zombie movie? Who are the zombies in the mind of the dreamer?\n\nSCIENCE: Continuing to evolve this understanding with our own modern spiritual commitment to science, we encounter the scientific conviction that there is no free will, that there is no consciousness or soul, that we are all only zombies, that everything we do is just the body doing it. The brain is just body. Thoughts are just material processes unfolding. The universe is deterministic, everything is causal, mechanical, and there is no free will in existence.\n\nROBOT: Here then we see the connection of the zombie with the robot. From Frankenstein to the mummy, zombie, robot, ghost and vampire, we’re dealing with representations of soul in relation to body. Pinocchio, robots in movies about the emergence of consciousness, zombies eating brains, soulless vampires with immortal bodies, reanimated mummies – and while all work with overlapping motifs, they all show us different features. We see the question of free will or consciousness appear with the zombie, puppet and robot, but where zombie emphasizes the body, puppets emphasize the control of others and robots emphasize the potential that we are empty of consciousness and free will in the first place.\n\nZOMBIE WASTELAND: The wasteland is a reality without vitality – sometimes this means without crops or babies or rain, but on another level, it's become about the lack of freedom or free will, spirit, soul and creative energies. This might look like a civilization collapsed or it might look like a society oppressed. In the case of oppression, we see dystopian narratives. In the case of collapsed civilizations, the wasteland is expressed by the inability to create the collaborations required to sustain society. This results in the normal motifs of the lack of food and resource, the lack of new creations and the lack of new infancy. The zombie takes wasteland imagery to another level. Here we see the body as a wasteland – a body without freedom or free will, without soul, without the ability to be a creator, as humans are meant to be, without the ability to procreate and in constant need of resource—especially food.\n\nNo creative power\n\nHEAD VS BODY – FEW VS MANY: Zombies are mirrors of us as zombies – not just as individuals but as collectives. When we see massive zombie populations creating an apocalypse, it plays into our fears of humanity consuming itself from overpopulation. Insofar as the zombie is always projected onto the mindless other, it sets up a psychological configuration that identifies one's own family or tribe or the cast of a movie as the center of consciousness meant to be saved from zombie hoards. But who are the zombie hoards? Are we just thinking about a literal zombie apocalypse, or do we project our fear of over-population onto populations we other, shadow and demonize? FUndamentally, the zombies are the many and the few escapees are the few. This, in some ways, is representative of the 1% in relation to the global population. So many zombie movies are about making it to the final encampment of well organized consciousness and governance, typically run by militaries with a white, christian and european lineages. Upper classes have always associated themselves with a higher caste and often with the head or crown, and they have often seen the masses as the body. The Zombie conflict is one of the head against the body, the many against the few.\n\nBIOLOGICAL INFECTIONS: Zombie infections are biological – from 28 days later to Kingsman and the Golden Circle. Biological infections or drugs are focused on the body and how the body infects or threatens consciousness, which we see in Golden Circle, when the zombie infection begins as a mind altering drug.\n\nSURVIVAL: Deepening the relationship of the zombie archetype with embodiment, zombie movies are typically about survival, and when it comes down to it, it's more about the survival of soul than the survival of body, as is seen when, film after film, protagonists prepare suicide of the body to save something more precious. The value system is clearly stated – life of the body is not the priority, which is what the zombie is all about.\n\nZOMBIE MYTH & GLOBAL MYTHOS: Each major myth in our global mythological landscape builds out our mythological imagination in such a way that both extends what it is but expresses consistency. Zombies, witches, vampires – they all fill out the psyche. Zombies are what we are in the normal world. Vampires are feeding off of them. Witches are repressed. Zombies are people of the wasteland, wasted people, spiritless bodies.\n\nSLAVE TO BODY & BODILY FUNCTIONS: Notice when people die in Zombieland – primary danger is going to the bathroom and trying to find food, whether it’s in a Twinkie truck or a grocery store. These are bodily needs that come from the process of consumption.\n\nAnimating the Golem: Animating the Image\n\nEnslaving the Body: Enslaving the Mind\n\nZombification, Hypnosis & the Enslavement of Consciousness through the animation of image.\n\nAdam, Frankenstein & C3P0\n\nNIGHTMARE OF SLAVES: The Zombie nightmare, to the slave, is the nightmare of continued enslavement, even after death.\n\nREVERSE CEPHALIZATION: Brain Eating – Killing Cephelazation – leaderlessness\n\nZOMBIE MOB DEMOCRACIES: Zombies, Mobs & Democracies: Zombification of voters enslaved by myths\n\nZOMBIE APOCALYPSE:\n\nIsis Threatens to smash down gates of underworld and make dead rise to outnumber and defeat the living\n\nAragorn – Undead Warriors overrun forces of Mordor\n\nChrist – Harrowing of Hell\n\nHAITIAN LAWS AGAINST ZOMBIFICATION – law recognizes attempt to put someone in prolonged coma or burying alive as murder\n\nCANNIBALISM AND MAD COW\n\nCONFORMITY - Getting bit by the conformists can make you conform"

With the help of the most modern research methods, he is examining the few fossil finds of Gigantopithecus. They reveal that the giant ape was a pure vegetarian and had to rely on extreme amounts of food due to its size. But during the ice age, the food supply was far too small. In addition, savannahs are gradually replacing the large forests. All of this suggests to the expert that Gigantopithecus is extinct.

The question is if they’re here today.\n\nBigfoot, known also as Sasquatch, has the appearance of a near-human great ape. From the forests of North America to the Himalayan Mountains, where the Yeti is found, these figures are hairy and strong, not as upright as we are, less capable of language, and still in the woods, which is the description of our own evolutionary ancestors. This is to say, one of the most interesting things about Big Foot, when compared to other mythical monsters, is that Scientists are actually firm defenders in the existence of what they are. The question is they’re still around.\n\nOne of the critical details when it comes to comparing Gigantopithicus with Big Foot is that its dental arcade is arch shaped, like ours. As we stood up and separated from the apes, we developed this arch and opened space for our voice. We see this in Gigantopithicus."

Do we have an animal nature that needs civilized? If you do, you have psyche to project into Big Foot.",
          "text": "Humans used to look in the mirror and see something like Big Foot, and so when we see big foot, we see our ancient selves, our animal selves. Wherever the stories and legends emerge, whatever their specifics, where they come from in us is our never ending relationship with our animal nature – sometimes repressed, sometimes engaged and always in contrast to what we are now: civilized.\n\nProjected, the repression of our inner animal can become a denial of Big Foot’s existence.\n\nAnd on the other side, the pursuit of Big Foot can contain the pursuit of our pre-fallen nature, which is why we can see some Big Foot hunters become like wild men. But this is only when it becomes extreme. Most of us oppress our ancient instincts and deny that wild men are real, but we are all drawn to our animal nature—an animal nature that Big Foot reflects.\n\nDenial of Big Foot is fuelled by the repression of our inner animal. Fascination with Big Foot is a fascination with our inner animal. And love of Big Foot is a love of our inner animal, which aligns with our understanding of what it was to be one with Eden and God before the fall. This is where we get images of Big Foot as possessing the mystical powers of Adam—our pre-fallen ancestor.\n\nFigures like the Big Foot or Yeti don’t just recur around the world and across our mythic landscape, we also dream and make movies about them. They’re in our mind. Not so long ago, we were more animal than human, we still have these tendencies, and in the same way we repress our animal instincts to be civilized, civilization denies the existence of bigfoot.\n\nIn the world’s oldest epic, Gilgamesh, the best friend and sidekick is a wild hairy man who lived in the forest, and, before he was civilized, terrorized people.\n\nThe archetypal essence of Big Foot and comparable figures is at least as old as old as the world’s first epic, Gilgamesh, who’s best friend and sidekick fit the core description: a wild, hairy man who lived in the forest.\n\nGoing back to the first epic, we see wild hairy men in the forest; and when we go back to Gilgamesh, the ancient source reveals an arc for this character: to become civilized. And so we see the true meaning of the myth of big foot – it is a civilizing myth. On one level, it’s about defining civilized consciousness by contrasting it with our animal nature, and on another level, it’s used to teach us not to believe in anything abnormal or undiscovered.\n\nIn this ancient source, we don’t just find a stagnant creature, we find a character arc. Enkidu, the best friend and Sidekick becomes civilized. This shows us what Big Foot is in our minds—a pre-civilized animal-person.\n\nFrom the Tibetan stories of the Himalayan Yeti to the North American Big Foot, we find stories about these comparable figures around the world. The Epics of India describe monkey people.  Hunters in the Caucasus learn not to track the hairy mountain dwellers. And the best friend of Gilgamesh, Enkidu, was a wild hairy man.\n\nBut this figure doesn’t just recur throughout our mythic landscape, Planet of the Apes is a recurring dream scenario. Big Foot, real or not, is an archetypal figure, and what it represents is our animal selves, which we repress, tame and shave.\n\nThe Yeti is a character in ancient legends and folklore of the Himalaya people. In most of the tales, the Yeti is a figure of danger.\n\nThe myth of Bigfoot comes from the indigenous cultures across the North American continent include tales of mysterious hair-covered creatures living in forests."

Myths answer timeless questions and serve as a compass to each generation. The myths of lost paradise, for example, give people hope that by living a virtuous life, they can earn a better life in the hereafter. The myths of a golden age give people hope that there are great leaders who will improve their lives. The hero's quest is a model for young men and women to follow, as they accept adult responsibilities. Some myths simply reassure, such as myths that explain natural phenomena as the actions of gods, rather than arbitrary events of nature."

And so, in the myth of Big Foot, we don’t just see an uncivilized monster, we also see a connected being, who, in some cases, has mystical powers. These powers are like those of Adam before the fall, lost to civilization.\n\nYETI - Big Foot\n\nArchetypal Concepts\n\nWE KNOW EVERYTHING & HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE: Myth that we can say we know there aren’t big foot—myth that we know everything and have seen everything and can never be surprised. Wild spaces are always disappearing to civilizations, this is the idea they’re all gone.\n\nNO ANIMAL IN HUMANITY! The myth of knowing everything focuses on the Big Foot, because what we are really eradicating is our own ignorance, which we associate with our animal selves.\n\nANIMAL IN HUMANITY - Gilgamesh to the tails we had in Eden, this is the animal self, which has been associated more with the female, as she was made from the tail, she is the mother of earth, she is the one closer to her body and instincts, which is why civilized women shave their bodies, which is a ritual of hiding, denying and repressing their animalistic nature, which has become mythically recognized as daemonic or chthonic or closer to nature. To say there is no more BigFoot is to say there is no more human-animal in humanity’s dreamscape. Flipped around, a planet of the apes, from the movies to my own dreams, are about a world run by animal nature. Human uprising within a planet of the apes, at least in my own dreams, are about awakening and living into what makes humans more than animal, which has to do with a type of consciousness that can step outside of a system and look at it, to see it from above — not an animal in nature, a conscious observing free thinking being that may have come from nature but has also achieved the level of self awareness required to transcend our basic animalistic nature. This is not to say animals aren’t wise, one with the universe, enlightened or ensouled — it’s to say that animals are still part of nature in a way that humans are not. We are in from and of nature, we are, but, we are also apart, even if it’s only in the way that we have the ability to think we’re apart. Big Foot is not apart, big foot is in and of nature.\n\nOPPRESSION OF NATURE CONSCIOUSNESS: The mythic demonization of our animal nature separates us from the consciousness our animal nature is capable of, which is its most mystical nature, its most telepathic nature, its most spiritually powerful nature. Or, is that just a half if it, is the other half the transcendent consciousness, is it married with the power of the natural consciousness — the alien and the big foot, the transcendent consciousness and natural consciousness.\n\nNATURE CONSCIOUSNESS & THE PARANORMAL: Unfallen consciousness and the capacities for telepathy, teleportation, etc. associated with BigFoot. Thus is the human before consciousness became overtaken by words, when it was as dream, and we lived in dream, and we interacted with it as a dream.\n\nPEOPLE ARE CRAZY & WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING! Myth about being crazy to believe, it’s paradoxically the thing that is a synonym for being crazy to believe while it’s also the most believable of all the ideas out there — it’s zoologically reasonable.\n\nTOLD YOU SO! If you find the big foot you are the one who proved everyone wrong and you are right — this is a huge psychological need for some people, to show they are right and that all the others who disagreed or thought they were crazy or wrong were wrong.\n\nCAUCASUS STORIES\n\nWild Man - John Colarusso - hunter story - “Mountain Man” - “It’s not mythical,” “father taught me not to hunt it, because it’s too dangerous, drew a funny footprint in the earth, and father said he had never seen one that far south, but that you will see the foot prints in the Caucasus” - Treacherous\n\nSome men gained reputation for bravery by going up in the hills to a clearing and lay out goods. After a day or so, one of these things would half show itself from around a tree, a gesture for big foot - a contact gesture - then encouragement to come out and to make an exchange. But it would always be a leader of a band — you’d only see the one. Ont he way back down, they were likely to attack to get back what they gave you.\n\nTIERA DEL FUEGO\n\nTiera del fuego - aborigine accounts of man in forest\n\nTibetans have 3 forms\n\nyeti, Méti, ziti — three kinds\n\nElongated skulls and red hair in Peru — 300 — no saggital suture and 25% larger than humans.

They weren’t witches until they were foreigners. Medea was not seen as a witch until she was seen as a foreigner.\n\nWitches and folklore — both coming from captured mothers — and maternal languages — witches are storytellers are weavers of tales are shapers of our world with our stories int he imaginations of kids…Disney now does what the witches did, tell stories to the kids. Which was also happening in Salem, it was the stories the witches were telling the girls that enabled them to see reality through their lens.

This is why the word Mater means both mother and matter in Latin[DS1] . The Material world is the mother’s world, earth, and like earth, the mother possesses the power of creation. This is why nature’s power of creation is associated with the mother’s power of creation, which is the foundational power beneath all witchcraft.\n\nMasculine envy for the mother’s power of creation is seen in the story of Zeus carrying Dionysus in his thigh, which serves as a makeshift womb.\n\nThis power of creation is not the power of a steam engine, gunpowder or money. The power of creation comes from the wombs of nature, not the mechanisms of human effort. The power of life and creation is understood to draw from powers yet untapped by humanity, powers that magic is meant to influence.\n\nThe annihilation of witches is inseparable from the rise of emphasis on human manipulation of the material world. Man vs. Witch is actually a Man vs. Nature story – the witch represents the forces of nature and creation that the Enlightenment paradigm wanted to repress.\n\nTheir vision of the world was a vision of dead matter interacting in purely mechanical ways. There is no magic in this system, which means there was no room for witches in this paradigm.\n\nSimilarly, where there is patriarchy there are witches. Where there is patriarchy there is the oppression of women and the repression of femininity. But again, the patriarchy isn’t just oppressing women for being women. In this paradigm that gives us mater as mother and matter, we also get Pater, which means father and pattern[DS2] . Embedded in the patriarchal oppression of women is the oppression of matter.\n\nThe oppression of matter, on one level, looks like the technological mastery of the material world and the social mastery of women. On another level, it looks like the philosophical objectification of both matter and women. Matter becomes seen as dead stuff. Bodies become seen as dead stuff. The material world with which mothers are associated shifts from being seen as alive with the power of creation becomes seen as a lifeless machine. To reduce matter to bodies comes with the reduction of women to bodies. Super interesting!"

          "question": "So why, why is masculine consciousness doing this? The answer is very simple. Ego and power. Men have been able to gain power over women, which has enabled them to build a world around the male ego. The male ego includes all of its fears and insecurities.",
          "text": "Fundamentally, men do not have the power to create, which means they live alongside a partner-gender with a supreme divine power that it cannot even begin to match. What happens in this situation? Fear and inferiority complexes start to create narratives that demonize and minimize this power in women. Measures are taken to reduce this power over them.\n\nAnd this is not the only power women have over men. Women are often experienced by men as more psychologically advanced, meaning they are more capable of manipulating them. Whether they do or not, the capacity is recognized, feared and reacted against. Thus we see narratives that demonize the feminine capacity to enchant.\n\nWe all fear enchantment when it comes to love, and from a masculine perspective, there have been negative romantic enchantments that ended in various suffering. This is remembered in the mythic record by those in power. These memories are turned into lessons when romantic interests are demonized for the way they can hurt us. In a man’s world, the one to blame will always be the woman. This rolls into the witch figures.\n\nThe power of wives over men is colored by the history of abduction. When women were stolen from war, not only were they likely to carry vitriol for their new husbands, they also brought technical and magical knowledge that was entirely foreign to their captors. Myths are filled with narratives of foreigner-witch-wives that jeopardize their husbands, from Medea to the mother of Alexandre the Great.\n\nMOTHER:  The other major experience of overwhelming feminine power is that of the mother from the perspective of the child. Thus we see wonderful fairy godmothers and terrible wicked witches throughout our folklore – these aren’t just representations of our various ways of relating to femininity and the power of nature, these are also representations of our various ways of experiencing the mother. The mother has absolutely overwhelming power over the child, who is completely dependent on the mother – like a human is on the earth. This sets up multiple layers of threat that can transmute into demonization narratives. The mother not only has the immediate power to nurture or punish, she also has the power of resource. Both are overwhelming powers for the child, which experiences early feelings of anger and resentment towards the mother for punishments and the withholding of nurturing. In the case of the most significant witch hunter of all time, King James, his mother’s love was withheld from him by another mother who decapitated her.\n\nMALE FEARS: In a world controlled by men, all of these masculine fears, insecurities and resentments of nature, creation, mothers, lovers and women comes together in the image of the witch.\n\nThe reason witches are associated with the devil is because the Devil has also come to be associated with the powers of nature, which is understood in a Christian consciousness as Fallen. Nature is constantly corrupting the soul, which is symbolized by the seductions of Pandora and Eve, who draw masculine consciousness into the fallen material world. This fallen world is the domain of the devils as much as it is the domain of women. From this perspective, the womb isn’t a great power of creation, it’s the portal through which souls fall. Thus the seduction of the devil and the seduction of the woman are one – both call for the fall, and both entice with the fruit and bodies of a material world. Both represent the magic of the earth, which is imagined to be at odds with the will of the heavens.\n\nOnce we recognize the association of the woman with the mortal and material, we understand why witches are so frequently beautiful or aged. They are beautiful to represent the seductive nature of the material world. They are aged to represent the dreaded reality of aging that comes from entering the body and its mortal material world. In the aged witch we see the transference of our own anxieties around aging and death.\n\nFor thousands of years, the West has lived within a bubble of perspectives that demonize women and present the material world as fallen. If we go back further in time and search further into the world, we find women-witches that carry all the powers of creation, maternity and seduction without demonization. We see this in the figures of Isis, Inanna and Aphrodite, all of which were associated with Venus, the first star you see at night, the wishing star — the green star associated with the power of love and creation.\n\nI think it’s important to go back and look at these figures. But it leads us to a key question – are the core qualities associated with the feminine, whether they’re seen in positive or negative lights – are these objectively feminine, or are these cultural contrivances? This is going to be an essential part of our conversation in the breakout.\n\nOne thing we will come to understand is that where some cultures aligned the earth first and foremost with the womb of life, other cultures prioritized a vision of a cosmic womb. These cultures tend to align the earth with the masculine and the sky with the feminine, which goes back to a memory presented by a key figure in the lineage of witches, Lilith, the first wife of Adam according to Hebrew folklore, who refused to let Adam be on top when they made love. This may be a memory of a historic power struggle between men and women, but it may also be a memory of a conflict between mythic interpretations of the sky as feminine or masculine.  This also sets up an association of the good mother with the heavens and the bad mother with the earth. This is seen with Mary, who is always dressed in Blue and seems to have been influenced by Egyptian iconography, which presented the heavens as a (blue) cosmic womb. Similarly, good fairies from Cinderella to the Wizard of Oz and Pinocchio are Blue. This is the divine good heavenly mother as opposed to the fallen, green faced witch so associated with nature.\n\n[DS1]Sorry, Will, where is that information from? From what I could find, mater really just means “mother”. However, the English terms “mother” and “material” both have their roots in the Latin “matr”. So the point does make sense, it is however a thought pattern in the English language – not in Latin. https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=matter\n\n[DS2]Again, this is a matter of etymology in the English language – not a variation of meaning in the Latin"

In these stories, dragon bones refer to coal that was used to heat the iron, which is revealed as the dragon blood that protected Siegfried – a poetic representation of Iron armor, including its flaw.\n\nThe Placebo effect is very real, but it only works when the imagination of the sick expects to be healed.

Think about the shape shifting that goes on in the wires to your headphones – the shape of the sound wave has become the shape of an electro magnetic wave that the speaker turns into a sound wave again that the ear turns back into an electromagnetic wave that the ear hears as a sound wave.\n\nSerpents are masters of the waves, masters of form. but another way to say this is that they are masters of form, and to the extent we see form and pattern as knowledge, they are masters of knowledge.

Because China’s river valley civilizations were never conquered by outsiders, they still valorize their dragons.

And as the river valleys were subdued, stories emerged of dragons defeated by heroes. The conquering emperors of China took a different approach, instead, they claimed to be the dragons and usurped their icons.\n\nThe same can be said of Uther Pendragon, father of Arthur, who, by stealing the dragon’s image, conflated it with tyranny. The dragon, itself, is not a tyrant. It is the flowing river, the flowing lava, the rainbow of freedom. Tyranny is when the river is conquered, when the mountain becomes a symbol of hoarding, and the rainbow becomes a mere call for gold. The dragon is cast as a demon by those who displaced those cultures that worshiped them and by those who wanted to conquer their rivers.

The more we want to believe in our dreams, however, the more likely we are to find them.

In 1835, there was a whale known as “Mocha Dick”, named for the island of Mocha off the Chilean coast, that terrorized and sank whale ships and was introduced in J. N. Reynolds’s May 1839 article in the Knickerbocker Magazine. The whale ship Essex was stove and sunk by a sperm whale in the Pacific in 1820, and Melville is known to have spoken to the mate, Owen Chase, about the incident. In 1851, another whaler, the Ann Alexander, was sunk by a sperm whale, but that was too late for Melville, since Moby-Dick was published in that year."

The return, conversely, is seen in the sunrise. It’s at the bottom of the ocean, then, in the middle of the night, that fire must be stolen.

Atlantis could be seen as a culture from a mythological time before the flood, vanished from a greater event."

If there was an early civilization that was flooded then the costal cities would have been lost like atlantis. In fact many great costal cities throughout history have probably been lost to moving shorelines.\n\nAnd so it is likely that the myth of atlantis was inspired by several real an mythical examples."

It’s hard to imagine that a culture wouldn’t have grown up and gotten rich where the Mediterranean and Atlantic connect, especially when you consider how much trade was going on between the North Atlantic and Mediterranean.

          "text": "The Fall of the Minoans started just after the eruption of Thera and continued until just after the fall of Troy. It’s possible that the Minoans participated in a larger alliance of sea faring cultures that included a significant port city in the Atlantic, and it’s possible a series of natural and human disasters led to the gradual decline of that network, which was ultimately displaced by Phoenicians around that time. From my point of view, the Minoans are not THE Atlantians, but given a few of Plato’s descriptions, it seems likely that they influenced his story."

If they did exist, however, there would have been traveling survivors, whose children would still be with us.\n\nThe culture of Atlantis is alive in the Brits, who seemed to feel existentially frustrated by a land-locked economy.
