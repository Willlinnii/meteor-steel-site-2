========================================================================
WHAT MAKES AGRIPPA'S SYSTEM DISTINCTIVE
========================================================================

Agrippa was a compiler and synthesizer, not an inventor. His genius
was organizational: he took scattered traditions and wove them into
a single coherent system spanning three orders of reality.

SOURCES HE DREW FROM:
  - Pliny the Elder's Natural History (stones, plants, animals)
  - Ptolemy's astrological writings (planetary rulerships)
  - The Picatrix (Ghayat al-Hikma, c. 10th-11th century Arabic;
    astral magic, suffumigations, planetary images)
  - Marsilio Ficino's De vita (1489) -- theory of harnessing
    celestial rays for health and talismans
  - Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's Oratio and Apologia --
    Kabbalah as compatible with Christian philosophy
  - Johannes Reuchlin's De verbo mirifico (1494) and De arte
    cabalistica (1517) -- Hebrew divine names, tripartite
    division of magic (natural, celestial, ceremonial)
  - Pseudo-Albertus Magnus (Liber de mirabilibus mundi)
  - Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (angelic hierarchies)
  - Hermes Trismegistus / Hermetic corpus (doctrine of
    correspondences, "as above, so below")
  - Jewish Kabbalistic texts (sephiroth, divine names,
    gematria, angelic hierarchies)

WHAT AGRIPPA UNIQUELY ORGANIZED:
  - The three-book structure itself is his innovation: Book I
    (Natural/Elemental magic), Book II (Celestial/Mathematical
    magic), Book III (Ceremonial/Intellectual magic). This maps
    the correspondence system across three distinct levels of
    reality -- sublunary world, stellar sphere, and divine/angelic
    realm -- with each planet having resonances at every level.
  - He systematized the magic squares and their associated
    intelligences and spirits more comprehensively than any
    predecessor, giving precise Hebrew letter-number values and
    showing how sigils are derived from the squares.
  - He integrated Kabbalistic angel names with the Ptolemaic
    planetary system more thoroughly than Ficino or Pico had done.
  - His planetary chapters (I.23-29) are the most complete
    Renaissance catalogue of which specific stones, plants,
    animals, and materials fall under which planet -- organized
    by sympathetic principle, not merely listed.
  - The suffumigation recipes (I.44) synthesize Arabic, classical,
    and contemporary practice into a planetary incense system that
    became the standard reference.

In short: the correspondences are mostly traditional. What Agrippa
contributed was the architecture -- the idea that a single integrated
table of correspondences could span from mineral to angel, from
incense to gematria, and that this table expressed a unified cosmic
structure rather than a collection of folk practices.


========================================================================
INFLUENCE ON DOWNSTREAM TRADITIONS
========================================================================

HERMETIC ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN (1888-1903):
  The Golden Dawn's systems of Kabbalah, geomancy, elemental and
  planetary attributions, and planetary seals and squares are taken
  in large measure directly from Agrippa. The magic squares appeared
  in various Golden Dawn grades. The planetary angel correspondences
  were adopted essentially intact. The Golden Dawn's "777"-style
  correspondence tables (later published by Aleister Crowley as
  Liber 777) descend from Agrippa's organizational framework.

ELIPHAS LEVI (1810-1875):
  Levi's Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie (1856) drew heavily on
  Agrippa's three-level model of magic and his planetary attributions.
  Levi was the primary conduit through which Agrippa's ideas reached
  the French occult revival.

ALEISTER CROWLEY (1875-1947):
  Crowley's Liber 777 is essentially an expansion of Agrippa's
  correspondence tables, extended to include Tarot, I Ching, and
  other systems. Crowley studied Agrippa directly and through the
  Golden Dawn curriculum.

ISRAEL REGARDIE (1907-1985):
  Published the Golden Dawn's secret rituals (1937-40), making
  Agrippa's planetary correspondences publicly available to a
  mass audience for the first time.

MODERN WICCA AND CEREMONIAL MAGIC:
  Contemporary planetary magic, herbal correspondences, crystal
  associations, and incense recipes in both Wiccan and ceremonial
  traditions trace back through the Golden Dawn to Agrippa. Many
  modern "planetary herb" and "planetary stone" lists are Agrippa's
  lists, sometimes without attribution.

In summary: Agrippa is the Renaissance junction point. Classical
and medieval lore flows into him; modern occultism flows out of him.
His planetary correspondence system is the single most influential
organizational framework in Western esoteric tradition.


========================================================================
NOTES ON ACCURACY AND LIMITATIONS
========================================================================

1. Agrippa's lists are extensive and sometimes inconsistent across
   chapters. The same stone or plant may appear under multiple planets
   depending on which quality Agrippa is emphasizing in a given passage.
   For example, the emerald appears under both Jupiter and Venus;
   the sapphire under both Saturn and Jupiter.

2. The "primary" correspondence listed above for each category
   represents the most frequently cited or prominently featured item
   in the relevant chapter. Agrippa typically lists many items per
   category -- the selections above are representative, not exhaustive.

3. Body-part attributions come from multiple authorities Agrippa cites
   (Hermes, Ptolemy, the Arabians), and these do not always agree
   with each other. Agrippa presents multiple systems rather than
   resolving contradictions.

4. The angel names use the standard Anglicized forms. Agrippa gives
   them in Hebrew characters. Transliteration varies across editions.

5. The intelligence/spirit names and their gematria values are from
   Book II, Chapter 22. Some numerical values differ slightly across
   editions due to scribal variations in Hebrew letter assignments.
