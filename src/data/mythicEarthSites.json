From death lead me to immortality.\n\n— Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.28\n\nIn the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape of a person. He looking round saw nothing but his Self. He first said, \"This is I\"; therefore he became I by name.\n\nHe was afraid, and therefore anyone who is lonely is afraid. He thought, \"As there is nothing but myself, why should I fear?\" Then his fear passed away. For what should he have feared? Truly fear arises from a second only.\n\nBut he felt no delight. Therefore a man who is lonely feels no delight. He wished for a second. He was so large as man and wife together. He then made this his Self to fall in two, and thence arose husband and wife.\n\n— Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.1–3 (trans. Max Müller)"
