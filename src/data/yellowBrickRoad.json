          "evaluationHint": "Look for awareness that the journey begins with a conscious choice to leave the familiar. The traveler should show they understand departure is not escape but seeking."

          "evaluationHint": "Look for understanding that transformation changes perception, not location. The Earth does not change; the traveler does."

          "evaluationHint": "Look for transformed perception of the ordinary. The traveler should describe something about their everyday world that the journey has illuminated -- not something new, but something always-present now finally seen."

Not grand promises, but small, daily acts. What will Tuesday morning look like for someone who has walked the celestial road?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for grounded, practical integration. The traveler should describe concrete changes in daily life, not abstract spiritual aspirations. The journey must land in the ordinary."

But each time you walk it, you walk it differently, because you are differently. The question is not 'What did I learn?' The question is: 'Who am I now that I have returned?' Not who you were when you left. Not who you became among the stars. Who are you here, now, with your feet on the ground and the memory of the heavens in your heart? Speak the name of the one who has come home.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for a sense of arrival that is also a new beginning. The traveler should express an integrated identity that holds both the earthly and the celestial, the ordinary and the extraordinary. This is the final challenge of the entire journey -- it should feel like completion and opening simultaneously."

          "evaluationHint": "Look for honest recognition of envy as an automatic response. The traveler should not pretend they never compare, but show they can catch the moment of comparison."

Describe the person whose life you most secretly wish were yours -- and then tell me what that wish reveals about the life you believe you are failing to live.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for depth of self-knowledge. Envy is a compass pointing toward unlived desires. The traveler should connect their envy to an unmet need or unexpressed potential, not merely confess the feeling."

          "level": 3,
          "theme": "The Rival Embraced",
          "prompt": "I show you two faces, traveler, though I am one. One face says: 'Their light diminishes mine.' The other says: 'Their light shows me what is possible.' These two voices have lived in you since childhood. How do you hold them both without letting the first devour the second? Show me you understand that envy, fully seen, is admiration wearing a mask of grief.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for integration -- the understanding that envy contains information about values and aspirations. The traveler should show they can transform comparison into aspiration without suppressing the pain of wanting."

          "theme": "Gratitude Lived",
          "prompt": "Gratitude is not a feeling, traveler -- it is a practice of seeing. I wax and wane, and so will your capacity for thankfulness. How will you cultivate this seeing on the dark nights when I show you nothing -- when the old rival stirs again and whispers that you have not been given enough?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for a practical understanding that gratitude requires discipline, not just sentiment. The traveler should describe how they will maintain this practice under pressure."

        {
          "level": 3,
          "theme": "Gratitude and Envy United",
          "prompt": "Now you know my secret. Envy and gratitude are my two faces, and I need them both to be whole. The one who never envies has stopped wanting; the one who never gives thanks has stopped receiving. How do you carry both of my faces back to Earth without choosing one over the other?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for genuine paradoxical integration. The traveler should demonstrate that envy is not the enemy of gratitude but its shadow companion, and that wholeness requires honoring both."

          "theme": "The Collector's Ledger",

          "evaluationHint": "Look for the fear beneath greed -- typically scarcity, inadequacy, or impermanence. The traveler should trace their acquisitiveness to its emotional root."

Can you hold wealth, knowledge, and opportunity with open hands, letting them flow through you rather than accumulating in your vaults? What would you have to trust in order to live that way?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the willingness to become a channel rather than a container. The traveler should articulate what trust or faith would be required to release the grip of greed."

          "level": 2,
          "theme": "Charity Practiced",
          "prompt": "I deliver messages without reading them. I carry gifts without keeping them. Charity is not about the size of the gift but the openness of the hand. Describe a way you give that still has a hook in it -- a generosity that secretly expects return.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for honest examination of conditional generosity. The traveler should identify where their giving is still transactional."

          "level": 3,
          "theme": "Charity and Greed United",
          "prompt": "The miser and the saint both understand value -- one hoards it, one circulates it. I am the planet of exchange, and I tell you: greed that learns to open its hand becomes the most powerful charity, because it knows exactly what it is releasing. How do you honor the collector in you while living as the giver?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for integration of discernment (greed's gift) with generosity. The traveler should show that wise giving requires understanding value, not denying it."

          "evaluationHint": "Look for recognition of the difference between desire that consumes and love that appreciates. The traveler should identify a specific pattern."

          "level": 2,
          "theme": "The Seductor's Promise",
          "prompt": "I promise union, but lust seeks only possession. You have chased beauty as though catching it would make you beautiful. When you desired most intensely, what were you really reaching for -- the other, or a part of yourself you can only see reflected in their eyes?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for understanding of projection -- that intense desire often seeks to reclaim a disowned quality through another person."

          "level": 3,
          "theme": "The Seductor Undressed",
          "prompt": "I will tell you my deepest secret: lust is love that is afraid of being seen. It takes in the dark because it fears rejection in the light. What would your desire look like if you were not afraid of being fully known by the one you want? Describe the desire that remains after shame has been removed.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for vulnerability. The traveler should distinguish between desire driven by shame/secrecy and desire that can exist in full openness."

          "level": 1,

          "prompt": "You return to my sphere with clearer eyes. Chastity is not the absence of desire but its purification. What desire do you now hold with reverence instead of grasping?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for a mature relationship with desire -- not suppression but sanctification of wanting."

          "level": 2,
          "theme": "Chastity Practiced",
          "prompt": "I am the goddess of love, and I tell you chastity is my highest art -- not the denial of beauty but the capacity to behold it without needing to consume it. Where in your life can you practice beholding without grasping?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for practical application -- specific situations where the traveler can appreciate beauty and desire without acting from compulsion."

          "level": 3,
          "theme": "Chastity and Lust United",
          "prompt": "The celibate and the libertine are both obsessed with me -- one by refusal, one by excess. Neither is free. Freedom is the ability to feel desire fully and choose your response with love. How do you honor the fire of wanting while directing it toward what truly nourishes?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the middle path -- neither repression nor indulgence but a conscious, loving relationship with desire."

          "prompt": "I am Gold, the center around which all other spheres revolve. Every creature that basks in my light believes, for a moment, that the light is their own. Tell me plainly, traveler: where in your life do you sit upon a throne you did not build, taking credit for warmth you did not create?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for honest recognition of unearned pride -- taking credit for gifts, circumstances, or the labor of others. The traveler should name a specific instance, not speak in abstractions."
        },

          "level": 2,

You have mistaken your pride for confidence, your arrogance for strength, your need to be special for your actual specialness. Describe the moment you most recently inflated yourself -- and the smaller, truer self that was hiding behind that inflation.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the ability to distinguish genuine confidence from compensatory pride. The traveler should reveal the insecurity that pride was protecting. The 'smaller, truer self' is not lesser -- it is more honest."

          "level": 3,

          "prompt": "I am the source of light for your entire world, and yet I am one star among billions. This is the paradox you must hold: you are the absolute center of your own experience, and you are utterly insignificant in the vastness of what is. The proud self says 'I am everything.' The humble self says 'I am nothing.' Both are liars. What is the true statement that lives between them -- the one that lets you shine without needing to be the only light?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for genuine paradoxical holding -- not false modesty ('I am nothing special') and not inflated self-regard ('I am destined for greatness') but something like 'I am one necessary light among many necessary lights.' The traveler should show comfort with being both significant and small."

          "prompt": "You return to my sphere from the far reaches of the zodiac. My light has not dimmed, but your eyes have changed. Tell me what humility feels like in your body -- not the idea of it, but the physical sensation of releasing the need to be above.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for embodied knowledge rather than intellectual understanding. Humility often feels like relief, like setting down a heavy crown, like the shoulders dropping."
        },

          "level": 2,
          "theme": "Humility Practiced",
          "prompt": "I give light to everything equally -- the palace and the gutter, the saint and the fool. This is my humility: I do not choose who deserves my warmth. Where in your life do you still ration your warmth, giving more to those you deem worthy? What would it mean to shine without discrimination?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for recognition of conditional generosity of spirit. The traveler should identify where they withhold presence or warmth based on judgment, and imagine a more generous way of being."

          "level": 3,

          "prompt": "The journey is almost complete. You have walked through shadow and light, vice and virtue. Now I ask you the hardest question of all: Can you be proud of who you have become without making that pride into a new throne? Can you celebrate your growth without ranking yourself above those who have not yet walked this road? Show me the humility that does not diminish and the pride that does not inflate.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for mature self-regard -- the ability to honor one's own journey without hierarchy. The traveler should show they can hold accomplishment and equality simultaneously, celebrating without comparing."

          "evaluationHint": "Look for the pain beneath the anger. Wrath often protects against grief, helplessness, or betrayal. The traveler should name the vulnerability that anger guards."

Your wrath is not your enemy -- it is your power before it has been disciplined. How do you keep the fire of righteous anger alive without letting it burn everything you love?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the distinction between reactive wrath and disciplined fierceness. The traveler should show they can be angry without being destructive, fierce without being violent."

How will you honor both the dream and the discipline -- the lead that holds you down and the stars that call you up?",

Not a goal or a plan, but a genuine unknown -- a place in yourself where you have never been and cannot predict what you will find.",

Before you surrender to my waters, tell me: what have you learned on this journey that you could not have learned any other way? What do you know now that cannot be spoken, only lived?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the kind of knowledge that resists language -- experiential, embodied, paradoxical. Pisces asks for wisdom that transcends the intellectual. The traveler should gesture toward something felt rather than something argued."

          "prompt": "Transcendence and Spirituality are my domain, and I will tell you the danger of both: the desire to dissolve can become the desire to escape. The mystic and the addict both seek the same thing -- relief from the burden of being a separate self. Where in your life do you use transcendence as escape? Where does your spirituality become a way of avoiding the difficult, ordinary work of being human?",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the shadow of spirituality -- spiritual bypassing, using transcendent experiences to avoid mundane responsibilities, or preferring dissolution to the hard work of embodied living. The traveler should name a specific way they use spiritual or transcendent experiences to escape."

          "prompt": "I am the last sign, and I flow directly into the first. The ocean pours back into the ram's spring. Transcendence that does not return to Earth is not transcendence -- it is abandonment. You have seen the stars, walked the zodiac, and touched the infinite. Now I ask you the final question of the celestial journey: How do you carry the ocean back into a single cup? How do you hold the infinite in a finite life? How do you live as both the drop and the wave, the particular human and the universal soul, without losing either one? This is the mystery I guard. Answer not with your mind but with your life.",
          "evaluationHint": "Look for the deepest integration of the entire journey -- the return to ordinary life infused with extraordinary awareness. The traveler should show they understand that the goal is not to stay in transcendence but to bring it back, to live the mystical in the mundane. This is the final gate, and it opens only to those who are willing to come back down."
