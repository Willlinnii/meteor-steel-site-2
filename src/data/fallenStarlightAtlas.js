  'golden-age': `Echo, a bit old for a dancer, performs in a lifeless studio among vibrating sand, organ pipes, and flame. A half-silvered mirror catches her eye—a bell grips her heart and pulls her to her knees. Aquariums shatter. She dances harder, defiant. The bell tolls again—her heart bursts. She falls. Darkness. Her body convulses like a puppet.

Six hours earlier. Jaq, twenty-eight, bright, soft, kind, opens mail at her tower house. A letter from Alma Pater University. Tears of joy gather—then wilt. She can't afford it.

Echo enters, excited about a new audition. She notices the crying. Jaq breaks: "I got into school." "The wizard school!? What's wrong?" "Why does it have to be so expensive? There's something wrong with our world. You shouldn't have to feed a broken system just to learn."

Jaq explains her passion: "Myths are spells! We're all under a thousand spells. Myths are lies, and I want out." Echo: "I thought you wanted to be a storyteller?" Jaq: "My dreams are still better than anything I could ever write."

Jaq takes a swipe at Echo's age. Echo, stabbed: "It's mean, Jaq, the worst, and it hurts the people who love you most." The door slams. Jaq curls into an anxious hole.

Jaq meets Anteros under an artificial tree. He proposes a mythic adventure together. She cries: "I can't. Because I don't love you."
"You really don't believe in love?"
"We are just dead matter under the illusion of consciousness. Nothing is anything but a bunch of stuff bouncing off stuff making bodies, and our bodies just want to mate, and eat. I don't want to mate and eat! I want to know."
He holds her tighter. "I think you love me too."
"NO! I don't believe in love, so I cannot be in love with you."
"Jaq, I think you are living proof that someone can love without believing."
She pushes him away, accuses him of being naïve or a liar. He's heartbroken. "Do you really not see my care and words as love?" She spirals: "Every belief is based on another belief. I haven't examined any of them. There is no knowing." He walks away, dejected.

At the hospital, Jaq visits Adam, her stern but sick mentor. "Why am I so mean to my sister?"
"You treat her the way you treat the part of yourself just like her. She's chasing her dream every day while you run from yours."
"I'm not ready."
"You're ready. I know because you are triggered by the people around you trying to answer their own callings."
He refuses a recommendation letter: "We are only allowed one relationship."
Jaq confesses: "I told my boyfriend I don't love him. Am I crazy?"
Adam: "Love serves the perpetuation and evolution of our species. Myths are lies, and love is the ultimate myth. The question is not whether love is real. The question is what love is."
"What is love?"
"A complex. When we find a relationship in which we unconsciously recognize all our past relationships, and when this person represents the parts of ourselves we want to integrate, lust looses the arrow of Cupid."
"Your complex is patterned by your atheism, and by an imprint of the paternal love god you've killed. You are drawn to men with paternal qualities in whom you see the god of love, who you then doubt, and this will destroy them, which will destroy you. This is your tragedy."
"The only way out is to see through love. Detach from it. Be a free individual. Love will try to take you over, but remember, it's not real. Everything is separate. The difference about you, Jaq, is you question the spells."

A text from Echo: I'm mad at you. But the audition is at a home address. 66 Deadwood. I want you to have it.`,

  'falling-star': `Jaq wakes. Echo's bed is empty, unmade. She panics—I've got you remains unsent. Calls go to voicemail.

Echo's agent: "Echo Stone? My darkest star. What's the project?" "I'm her sister. She didn't come home. She went to an audition at 66 Deadwood." "I told her! My clients keep taking these calls, against my advice, and it's the last I ever hear from them. Ask the police! Don't call me."

Jaq calls the police: "My sister is missing. She went to an audition at 66 Deadwood."
"66 Deadwood? We get this call. Your sister is not on the premises. We have closed our investigation. It's a school. None of them come home. Chasing their dreams. If your sister didn't say goodbye, consider it personal."

A falling star lights her face—the whole room. A meteor, arrowhead-sized, craters her front lawn, destroying her golden mailbox. She picks up the glowing stone. A gold leaf letter from 66 Deadwood lies in the debris.

She calls Nin: "I got a letter from 66 Deadwood."
"What the fuck does it say?"
"It's an invitation to an initiation in myth and story."
"That is not real. This is some devil shit."
"I think my sister got this letter."
Nin: "At the house?! Without Tero or the police? Are you crazy? Tell me you're not curious!"
"Of course not! Maybe a little. But it's my sister, and she's missing."
"Do you want me to come?" "No. Be on the phone. And if I'm gone too long, get help."

She puts the meteor in her purse and looks at the envelope.`,

  'impact-crater': `She drives through tunnels of autumn leaves at golden hour. A mansion of brick. Cars line the driveway, jammed between statues of Cupid, satyrs, wolves and dragons. She calls Nin: "Stay on the phone."

She taps shoulders in the long line. One man: "I have been called to purify my warrior spirit. I am to become a great hero." Another: "The secret to success is in this house. The secret of pure power and incorruptible will."

Shadow hooks her eye. She follows it around the house into a wasting garden—a dry, cracked fountain. The door is unlocked. She enters halls of red velvet, black and white tile, paintings and sculptures. Her phone loses signal.

In glass cases she finds a small coffin shaped like a woman's body, wings wrapped around her womb. Inside: an adze, a copper Was scepter the size of a key. Shadow leads her to a red door. The adze fits the keyhole.

In the Salon: calendars, globes, wheels and books—Descent of the Goddess, Hero with a Thousand Faces, Allegory of the Cave, Star Wars, Save the Cat—and more. Stuffed on top: a worn folder. All shadows in the room are drawn into its folds like a genie to a lamp. It reads: Story Atlas & the Golden Wheels. Red pen, a work-in-progress. She takes it.

Puppet-women chase her through the halls—glossy skin, diamond eyes, moving like cymatic-puppets to the music. She runs, finds a studio with a lifeless woman on the floor. The puppet hoard swarms. Shadow shoots from her purse to storm shelter doors. She follows—bowled over, they fall, down.

She descends through a stair squarcase, a vortex, the snort of a sperm whale, a crack in earth. She divides like a cell through double slits and sees herself in refraction—a rainbow of selves, translucent, wave-like. She reaches for an apple—it turns gold. She snaps to a single body. In her hand, a walnut-coffin carrying a seed.

She awakens in a gondola in river caves. The boatman Set wears the robe of Death. Glowing bubbles rise. "Life is abandoned here, why can you see?"

On a golden island at sunset, golden apples fall like little suns. She awakens clutching her purse. The meteor splits in two—from it falls a chain of seven metal links: Gold, Silver, Iron, Mercury, Bronze, Copper, and a hook of lead. She puts on the earrings and sees her reflection—ruby lips, sparkling eyes. Her feet glow like coals. Steam billows. Rainbows flare. Her heels of meteor steel: quenched, cooled, dark, silvered.

A mountain rises—lead at the base, copper belt, tin slopes, mercurial crags, rusty rocks, silver clouds, golden capstone. She clicks her heels three times.

There's no place like home.
"Who's there!?" Did you steal a book?
She looks in her bag—no book. "How did you know?" I am that book. "The Story Atlas?" Story Atlas. "Can you help me?" I don't know. "My sister. I have to rescue her."
Did you read the book? "I flipped through it." This world appears to be drawn from my pages. The space we are in is time.
Golden apples on a golden island at sunset? Are you disoriented—like you've been swallowed by a whale? "You could say that."
I can only tell you the when of where we are. We stand at the crossroads of day and night, summer and winter, wake and dream, life and death. This is the threshold crossing—when we are swallowed into the belly, into the nightsea journey. Did you come through a wardrobe or rabbit hole, over a rainbow or through a mirror?`,

  'forge': `Bricks form a path. Zombies—puppets to the solar sound—pass Jaq, golden goggles on their faces. A brick rises to her face. What's happening?
This is a test, on the road of initiation.
She accepts the brick and locks into step. Atlas explains: Yellow brick roads are the paths of sun, soul and seed through night, death and gestation. What begins as a golden path of support becomes a golden chain of responsibilities, until you are someone else's prison bars.

In Plato's Cave, gold flickers from a central hearth. Employees with gold-tinted glasses watch their shadows. BB, a skeleton of gears in a golden mantle, plays billiards. "If you can put down the cue, you can leave."
BB: "All that exists fits in these walls. Matter is dead. Causality is all there is. There is no life, no freedom, only common sense." With each shot, Jaq's cue turns gold. A cuff appears. She cannot let go.
Atlas whispers: This is not right. This place is upside down. He's training you to the normal, but it isn't normal here. Ask him the questions. I will give you the answers he hides.
"Have you told the whole truth?" A ball sinks. "Objectively."
Atlas: His lies guard a broken door. His fanaticism hides doubt. Golden bars are beams of light. Golden weights are balls of energy. Golden chains are waves of freedom.
BB sinks the eight. "Prepare to never leave." What do I do?
The doors are wide open. You have to believe. In what? The impossible—that you can save your sister, that there is free will, that the world is not dead, that everything is not separate.
But I can't! I know the world is dead. I don't believe in free will!
Then you have imprisoned yourself.
She seizes, falls unconscious, wakes. Atlas: You have known for a long time.
"Matter is energy." Break—a ball sinks. "There are swerves in causality." She hooks shots, finds quantum options. BB screams: "You cheated!" "Reality cheated." She breaks free. His cue becomes a sickle, his body turns to lead. "We will meet again."

Kedalion, an old dwarf, appears. "You did it! We have to wake you up." He shows her—she's still in the cave, restrained, a brick on her face. "This is a cave of dreams. Your dream is to be here." Chains fall from her sleeping self. She wakes—one self again.

Through an oculus, Kedalion grasps a clod of earth. "Have you heard it said, God is Dead? Before that, it was said the great god Pan is dead. Pan means all. All is dead." A sod grows and dies in his hand. "Pan is the god of nature. Nature is dead. Life is denied—in us, in the world."
He holds a tree star leaf. "Is there not life in this leaf? Of course there is! Pan is NOT dead, my dear, and you are in his broken heart. Everything you see here is him, everyone you meet."
He explains the Mythouse: "Before he fell, the devil was the Peacock Angel, spinning straw into gold, creating myths as prisons—first for dissenters, then for imagination itself. Three thousand years ago, his prison failed. He created this one."
"How do I escape?" "Heal Pan's heart."
"Conscious parts of Pan's psyche repress my deformations. The more repressed, the more likely to crack reality." He is the dwarf Shiva dances on—"the shameful, the ugly, the crippled." Jaq wraps her scarf around him. "If beauty isn't everywhere, fuck beauty. I think you are beautiful."
"You are escaping the lesser prison of dead matter. Ahead is the greater prison. Only Eros, the meteor, the phantom forced underground, remembers how to destroy it. Find him." He looks at her starlight heels.

Road of the Forge. Sisyphus finds Jaq. A boulder forms around her possessions. "Why will you climb?" "For my sister."
"You think you're here for your sister?! I climb for me. You must climb for you." He teaches the ideology of purification: "This is your philosopher's stone. Impurities will fall away. Matter will be purged from spirit. Only gold—pure individuality—will remain."
"When you grasp the nature of true purity, you realize the purest ethic is to be perfectly self-serving. On the outside we wear love, but the pure golden core is always individuality. To reach the summit, put yourself above all else."

They climb Mt. Cosmos through the planets—the seven metals, sins, and chakras:

Saturn's Cave: Cronos drinks in melancholy amid clocks and trains. "Saturday, the root chakra of sloth. Transcend the fear of death. Take responsibility for yourself. Break the cycles." Jaq tricks Cronos by claiming to be "Nobody" and the black sheep. He sleeps. She escapes under his rams at dawn.

Venus' Beach: "Friday, the second chakra, where pleasure and hedonism defeat love. Transcend the needs of procreation with chastity, simplicity, moderation."

Jupiter: "Thursday, the third chakra of gluttony. Liberation comes from self-control, humility, fasting. The path from tyrant to teacher." They trick Zeus with Prometheus's sacrifice—fat hiding scrap, stomach stuffed with meat.

Mercury's Ziggurat: "Wednesday, the heart chakra, where open communication can leak. Here we learn to hoard—especially truth, especially selfishness."

Atlas warns: This isn't right. This place is a prison.
Jaq: What other choice do I have? I feel so strong. Maybe this is a path to power.
Can't you feel self becoming reason?
What would you know of self? You're just a book.
Atlas goes silent.

Mars: Iron war dogs and soldiers on a train. "Tuesday, the fifth chakra of courage. Patience must be overcome by wrath, willful recklessness." They traverse iron deserts of magnetic sands.

Golden Middle Way. On Mars, a meteor craters nearby. Eros, a man of meteor steel, flies from the site with eyes of starlight. For a second, Jaq sees Anteros. Men in black open fire. Bullets catch in a field of magnetism. He takes her hand. They fly.

In an obsidian cave: a masquerade of all eras. Painted caves, stone circles. An eclipse frames Jaq and Eros. In darkness, in a carbon-black blindfold, he holds her. Light floods the room.

Dream-conversation with Eros: "This is ritual. This mountain is stripping you of life. We are where vitality goes. Your sister isn't here yet. We would be soon."

Moon: "Monday, envious sixth chakra. Relinquish duality. Cut off your shadow. Shatter the mirror." A silver gun appears in Jaq's hand. She sees Echo in the mirror, nearly rotting. "She's not you!" She fires. The mirror shatters. Sun blinds her.

At the solar peak, Ra sits golden on his throne. "At last, my initiate and loyal servant."
Sisyphus: "I am not your servant!" Ra swats him away.
"Free from the wheels of eternity. You have completed all rituals but one, to claim your power."
A man is chained before Ra. An eagle tears at his liver. "I'm here for my sister."
"You came for your power! Power submits to power. You are just a little girl."
She removes the iron mask: it's Eros. "Give up your rebellion. Remove those earrings. Deposit them in the abyss through his wound."
"This is Mount Power. Love makes you weak. The path to greatness is paved with sacrifice." Narcissus grow in his blood.
Jaq looks at Eros. He speaks: "Love is life." His arrow pierces her heart.
Ra: "Ignore him! Purify the world! Let him transcend!"
Eros whispers: "Doubt everything." The dam breaks. Flooded with doubt, she falls to her knees.
Meteors shower from the polestar, pummel the mountain, pierce the eagle, break the golden chains. Eros falls into the abyss. Jaq leaps to save him. They pull each other up. The mountain erupts.

Via Negativa. Eros and Jaq descend into caves of lapis lazuli. "Purity is a delusion of self-identification. Show me purity—I will show you denial. Body is real. Hunger is real. They cannot be split away, only cast into shadow."
"Was this your revolution?"
"Integration—of all that had been cast out, called impure. A revolution of oppressed masses, foreigners, minorities, feminine and indigenous. Against static hierarchy—against a world cast in precious metals."

He grasps clay, spins it into a goddess. "As humans emerged from nature's dream, they saw life in earth. The mother was a goddess. When metals were unlocked, earth became seen as impure. The mythology of metal was a weapon—the weapon of purity. Dirt, body and the feminine became corrupt. Women became devils. Bodily drives became deadly sins."

He takes Jaq's meteor to his forge. "Throughout the age of precious metals, technology fell from the sky—unidentified falling objects, metal too hard to shape. When someone finally drew swords from the heavenly stones, the Bronze Age collapsed."
"Is meteor steel that much stronger?"
"Its starlight was a revelation, a poetry that reframed life."
"What's in the poetry of meteor steel?"
He forges her steel. "Do you know our first steel? Light from the heavens. Stones destined to be drawn as blades. What's different about this sword? Why is the steel smith black? Why is the metal dark?"
Her face lights up: "Impurity!"
"The stone that had been cast out." He quenches the sword in milk. "This is forgotten poetry. This steel is Achilles, Excalibur, Sosruquo and Siegfried, Iron Man and the Iron Giant, Black Panther, Wolverine, Stardust and the Rings of Power, Mandalorians, the Man of Steel—Meteor Steel. A revelation of fallen starlight, and it wants to be known."
He gives her the sword. "Two choices. Solve everything, save everyone, transmute our world. Or behead the snake, kill the tyrant, and start it all over again."
"How do I save my sister?" Eros is disappointed. "Its weak spot is the heel. The sword has a memory. As long as you hold this blade, you cannot be harmed. It cannot be taken—only given."
He also gives her a golden ring—Thy Will Be Done, the Ring of Power. "Whatever thou shalt will, will find voice. But if you put others under your will, you will be a tyrant."
"Is that so bad? To be a hero?"
"Be a hero! You are more than a hero. You are a young girl not as young as she used to be, who hasn't accomplished as much as she hoped, who's mean to her loved ones and struggles with depression. The ring hates weakness. It will tempt you to remake the world in your image. Don't."
Through the ring she sees Echo hanging from an obsidian tree among a thousand corpses. "I didn't come to turn the page."`,

  'quenching': `Jaq fumes through the passage. Are you there?
Atlas: I'm here, in new form. Do you miss the heels?
Yes I miss the fucking heels!

Beneath the obsidian canopy, mummies hang from the tree—thousands of them—in spider silk. When are we?
Midnight, new moon, winter solstice, eclipse: we are entering the Nadir, the quiet, the extinguished throne room, the zeroic. Old light goes out.

The serpent of gold spirals inside the hollow trunk. An obsidian throne sits empty—a monolith. Echo hangs in bandages above a boiling black cauldron. Atlas asks: What happened?
I was told what I shalt do—figure it all out, transform the dream, or kill the tyrant, save my sister, bring down the mountain. Reboot the prison.
Would everything return to how it was?
It seems so.
This is why I was put down. This is why my author couldn't finish me. He saw me as a weapon—for a thousand revolutions—but here you are, renewing the status quo.

Shadow consolidates into Obsidian on his throne. "You think I can't see you? You think I don't know of your precious rebellion?"
"Why did you help me?" "To be my silver platter. To bring me my sword."
She remembers: it can only be given. The sword has a memory. "I think you're afraid."
He laughs. The dragon strikes like lightning. She's faster—she IS lightning, raw spirit. She decapitates the snake. "No more illusions."
"How dare you steal from us! How dare you take our lives!"
Obsidian smiles. "Pure evil? Look at you, overwhelmed with rage. I manufacture consent to order the world, to save it from chaos, to empower individuals, to transcend the limitations of nature! I purify."
"Glass breaks." She goes for his throat. He's smoke, silence, ash.

The mountain rumbles. She snaps from her rage: "Oh no. What have I done?"
Are you there? Silence. Fuck.
"Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha"
She looks at the cauldron. Stolen people dangle behind her. "Behold your weakness, all the metals, all the corruption you split away."
She removes the ring and drops it into the cauldron. The ring melts. She looks at the sword—holds it and a clod of dirt over the molten metal.
"You wouldn't dare."
It will be okay. I know.
"Fuck you! And fuck your purity." She releases sword and soil.
"No! That's mine!"
It boils and transmutes like a peacock's tail, a rainbow. She lifts the dish to her lips, kisses her reflection, and drinks in her other.
Starlight fills her eyes and grows until she is light. Darkness. She falls unconscious.

In a garden, Cupid sits beside her. "Your sacrifice has brought you here. It felt heroic, didn't it, to slay your dragon?"
"Yeah."
"The heroic ego had to die. It was angry, wasn't it? So offended, so righteous, so blind."
"And now?" "I feel defeated."
"What lost can't win. Why did you drink the mettle?"
"That I let him make me what I was. For letting him split me in pieces—for letting him teach me to hate myself."
"You hated him." "I hated myself."
"Good. And now?"
"I want it all back! I want to be all of me. I missed it. I felt emotionless. I just wanted to be whole."

"You don't know what you did. When you drank in yourself and all you had othered, how did it feel?"
"Like everything—all at once."
"And then?" "I was extinguished."
"Do you feel less like you when you're quiet, when you're empty, when you're still?"
Tears flow. "No. I feel like I'm all here."
"You have been quenched, like hot steel, in a field of awareness. This is presence."

"Remember the pool table? Imagine instruments inside each ball—horn, drum, guitar. When they clack, they make sound. Listen to the game."
She watches BB break and hears instruments. The secret is not in the table. It's in the sound. No matter how many instruments, your eardrum vibrates with a single vibration containing all vibrations.
The spiritual journey is from a perception of separateness to a vision of togetherness. This is a journey to elixir. Mythic elixirs carry the secret of waves.
"When you hear all the notes of all instruments in a symphony, you hear one wave. Waves can be one and many."
"And we are waves."
All of us.
"Nothing is separate—not sand, stone or particle."
Yet everything is individual.
"I drank it in."
You drank it in.

"Look directly ahead. Pick a point. Settle your gaze. Let the letting go. Be still and grow."
The world blossoms from her center into living geometry, into Visionary Experience.
"What do you see?"
"I never knew I was in. I am in."
"Do you feel in?"
"And of, and with." "With what?"
She sobs. "Life."

"This is what you came to learn. You are alive! It's all alive! Too afraid to look, life has been hidden behind walls of the mind. Nature has been reduced to resource, for a people that would leave. Progress thinks it will kill nature someday. It cannot. This long arc away from nature has come to a turning point, and to make this turn, you need old weapons."

"Has Atlas spoken of meteor steel?" No. "Then why are your earrings starlight? Why are your heels steel? Life brought you in, to this world of imagination, to heal in its own language. Life brought him here, with you, to rewrite the book—to reveal the weapon kept secret through time, to identify the flying object."

"The prison is cracked. It will burst and reform to its natural flow."

The obsidian throne room floods. Bees descend through branches. Dancers burst free from cocoons. Jaq lies by the empty cup, earrings returned, heels quenching in the flooding ground. Blood drops from Echo above onto Jaq's eyelid. Her eyes shoot open. Echo roars with labor.

Jaq takes her sister. "You will never escape," Obsidian bellows. A radical root sprouts beneath the vessel. Jaq peers in the bowl's reflection of the mountain above. She steps in. Bees and dancers follow.`,

  'integration': `Atop the golden summit, green shoots grow from Jaq's heels. The mountain turns inside out—hollow cone. Honey flows upward through the lunar mirror. She calls Atlas. "Are you there?"
In a way. Something is different. I think I am being rewritten.

The volcano explodes with magmic water. She flows to the mirror on a wave of honey in a golden cup-boat. When are we?
The road back, the magic flight. When the radical first root grows into a network. Resolution begins and authorship is claimed.

Return through the planets—each transforming:

The Moon cracks like a black mirror. Obsidian's face appears: "You set me free to be nothing—the everywhere you can never escape." UFOs give chase. Sisyphus appears in winged sandals, curse broken. "Now let's get you out of here."
Jaq sees dark UFOs. Sisyphus: "I don't see anything." Atlas: Abandon fear and terror, and you will recognize what appears as your mind's projection.
This is when to remember how far you've come. This is when your heart opens and flies back from the great below. You can do it.

"If you want life to see you, see what life sees." Meteors shower with flaming tar and garbage. "He didn't expect it—everything he refused to see—but it's making him stronger, more whole. If this place can transform, it must be healed with immunities—to dead matter and purification."

Mercury: "Greed exhales from Hermes. His ancient coffers erupt with charity." Jaq channels Mercury: "Light as a feather, happy as an angel, merry as a schoolboy." The planet's chains flow like cleared veins.

Jupiter storms fiercely. "Thrones crumble as Zeus remembers. His rise was for freedom—for everyone." Jaq's eyes crackle: "Fall in love with life again."

Venus: "Love erupts through rinds of pleasure. She recognizes everyone. She co-experiences with everything." Jaq's eyes glow copper: "To see in full beauty, know life. You will find life knows you."

Saturn: The train has deconstructed—cars orbit trackless, autonomous. Cronos meditates. "Sloth transforms through meditation into mysticism. Stillness opens space for flow. Surrender of control restores Self-authorship." A new car appears—Uranium. It breaks toward...

Uranus blips into being. Radiates static. Kaleidoscopes into cymatic form. "Magic is not fantasy! Uranus, Prometheus—he has always been here."
Her eyes go radioactive. "The writer writes of cymatic bees, meteor steel and elixir waves."
"He didn't put down the book to put down a weapon. He put down his obstacle—to self and creation. He brought you here to give you life so he could survive. If there is anything you'd like to say, he's here."
Oh.
Atlas speaks to the author: I'm sorry for the thousand nights, for the fixation on my birth, for time he gave me and not to his people. I'm sorry for Leela's coma, and her struggle for rebirth. I feel responsible.
He knows it was not your fault. You were not a bad complex. You were The complex. He believes in your original purpose—a secret weapon, a great equalizer, for a thousand stories.
She stops. "He needed me."
Is he writing you? She listens. "No."
When this is over, will I just be an Atlas?
No. People will talk to you and ask you questions about their journeys, about life. You will be precious. You just needed a story to find your soul.
A rear wheel on the golden train reveals a rim of meteor steel. All but one wheel I recognize.

Earth. "Now you know the mountain's truth: its base is earth and always will be." They ascend the inverted mountain. "There's no place like home." The world flips. Water cascades. They enter...

Plato's Cave. Jaq approaches the billiard table. "Eeeeeehhhhyyyyyyaaaahhhwweeeehh." The surface ripples like water. Balls become whirlpools. Bees buzz. Cymatic patterns bloom. BB turns to sea blue water, then flesh. She kisses his forehead. He weeps. Sisyphus shoulders the table—a massive boulder. They break it free. Chaos, efficiency—chains broken, headsets shattered, people awaken.

On the golden island, Wolf waits. "Are you ready to arrive?"
"I am ready to return! Who are you?"
"I am Wolf. I am Storm. I am the lightning-bolt. You have done well. Life believes in you. You still don't believe in your life. Doubt got you here. It won't get you home."

Set arrives in a living ark—tree roots woven into hull, branches into sail. Wolf speaks:
"Movement is trying to happen. There are many efforts to save life on this planet. They will all fall short without an awakening—to nature as church and life as Bible, to the poetry, the ceremony, the living revelation. Until life is seen in the leaf, until the forest is known as cathedral, the effort to save your shelter will prove too weak."

You have destroyed the lesser prison of dead matter. You have disrupted the greater prison of purification. You have learned to see life as poetry and opened the eye of your heart.
What has happened here will ripple into the world. A world free of prisons can be born, from life. Or we can forget, rebuild the prisons. No—it has to end this time.
This world wants to heal. Shadow has fled to the world above. He will seek to weave a new web. You must free the imagination. When you do what's right, solidarity you could never imagine will be there to meet you.
Money and power cannot do what you can do. Lead those who can lead themselves—not with rules, not with examples, but with connection. A free imagination, in touch with life, is powerful and dangerous.
The lack of education will shock you. Wisdom must be shared. The future is in those who can meet nature—who can heal their break with life. Like arks in a flood, they will survive the crisis of spirit. Your journey does not end with your return.

They pass through the pole star—a sixteen-petaled tunnel of blue light. This is when you sprout.`,

  'drawing': `Twilight outside the Mythouse. Anteros and Nin sleep in his car. They startle awake. The gates are sealed with a golden chain. Bolt cutters won't cut. Tree stars burst through cracks in stone.

In the Mythouse Garden, in the shell-stone well, Jaq holds Echo. The well fountains with foam. Bees swarm the lifeless garden—vibrations hook leaves with green life. They do not catch. The bees become dancers—hundreds. Echo labors. Jaq steps from the well, heels and earrings gleaming, and lays down her sister.

Obsidian, a cloud of incomplete incarnation, lifts his arm. He tries to reclaim the zombies. Dancers seize and fall. Their skin hardens into cocoons. "You're all dead! It's all dead! You don't believe in love. You don't believe in life! It was all wish fulfillment! Fantasy! Corruption! Give me my starlight, and fade back into obscurity."

Her heels and earrings dim and disappear. She opens her purse. The book glints—its cover now reads: Revelation of Fallen Starlight. She draws out the meteor.

"You are impure, unclean, unfaithful and made of sin. You are a broken woman. I will not let you infect the world. They will cancel you, like a criminal, like a foreigner. Corruption gives way to corruption."

Jaq slings the stone at his forehead: nothing. The meteor transforms into a sword of starlight in his hands. He sees his reflection: Shadow, then BB, then Ra, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn.

Echo screams a final push. "Matter is not dead or impure, it's alive."
Echo opens her eyes. She stands and moves to the center. She begins a new dance—graceful gestures drawing clarity through a sea of sound. The chrysalis shells vibrate and resolve into colorful mummies. She breathes with the leaves, stomps with the earth. Like fire, she cuts the space. Like water, she brings it together. Green comes.

Obsidian fights Shadow, until it grows like grape vines into the garden.
"You cannot control what we see and believe—not anymore. If you cannot kill me, if you cannot steal life from my imagination, you cannot play dead!"

Mummies stand and join the dance. The mansion cracks. A mound swells from below—walls crumble and circulate—becoming a comfortable home in the ground with a round green door and a brass knob.

"I know what's in your heart. I have met your fractured pieces. I have shared your life!"
Green sprouts from his obsidian surface. Kedalion, on the shoulder of Sisyphus, waves at Jaq.
Obsidian sees Eros in the blade. Connection flows until Pan of a thousand faces arrives.
Tree stars erupt from the sword. It falls to the ground—reclaimed by sound and green. Dancers dance. Life flows. The garden grows.`,

  'new-age': `Jaq looks in the eyes of Pan, knows Eros, feels Sisyphus, sees Kedalion.
"What will happen now?" "What happened here will happen everywhere. A new story will begin."
"What will happen to this place?" "The one who made it will return."
"Has it been destroyed?" "Healed, but poison is part of this world."
"Then I will keep healing with you."
"There will be another time to defend my heart, but not today. Go out into life. Bring what you are into the recipes of your experience. Be with life!"
"If you are whole now, what is this place?"
"They were never me. I was their prison. The space you were in was time, the dimension of soul, the world of imagination—a dream, bent by my hurt."
"Thank you." She lays her purple scarf around his neck. Their foreheads touch. He fades into their mixing shadows.

Jaq rushes to Echo. She brushes away bandages. Echo has given birth to herself. A falcon cries. Chrysalis-chests of a thousand dancers erupt with butterflies.

Outside, golden chains diffuse into sunlight. Anteros bursts through. He stands at the opening—hair lit by rising sun. Tired, filthy, dedicated.
Jaq comes to him. They embrace. "I love you," she says. "I know."
"I can't." "I know."
"Not right now."
"You are so big. I see it. I feel it. And I love you. And I want you to be big. And it's not that I would keep you small..."
"I know."
He cries. "But you have to go somewhere, and it's not with me." She kisses him, passionately. She gives him her light and darkness. He's there with all that she is. They kiss through tears until they can't, and release. It's over. It's sad—and okay.

Echo and Nin join the huddle. Foreheads. Love. Trust. Presence.
"Are you okay?" Jaq asks her sister.
"I felt everything. All I could do—" She heaves with panic. Silent sobs.
It's okay.
Echo's eyes turn toward Jaq. When my life was ebbing, I remembered—
"I've got you."
Echo breathes. "Endure. All I could do was endure." The grief, shame, and shock flow. She smiles with relief.

Nin asks: "Where was all this life?!"
Jaq laughs. "Waiting." "For what?" "Hope."

The young tycoon returns the meteor. The soldier sings a honey song. Dancers leave through the gate. The once-lifeless woman from the studio looks back—grateful, alive—surrounded by a doorway wreathed in tree stars. Jaq winks.

She puts the cornerstone in her purse and looks to her friends. They join arms. "Are you ready?" They nod and return—at home in the world.`
