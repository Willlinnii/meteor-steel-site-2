  "golden-age": "For thousands of years, metallurgy unfolded under a single guiding paradigm: purity creates strength.\n\nGold, silver, copper, and bronze are known as precious metals. From age to age, what they share in common is that they were improved through purification. The more pure the precious metal, the more immortal it becomes. They are stronger and last longer when purified of non-metal matter. Copper and gold, silver and bronze become stronger and more enduring when purified. When they became currencies, their value was pegged to their purity.\n\nEarlier metals were not quenched. They were heated and allowed to cool. Precious metals had been unlocked by fire alone.\n\nFor thousands of years, through the early chapters of civilization, metallurgy was a partner in the rise of great cities. Through this entire arc, metallurgists pursued purity. In the centuries that followed, alchemical language framed matter as fallen—sometimes even as impure. For gold, silver, copper and bronze, carbon, as with any earthen matter, was a critical impurity. Instead of integrating charcoal, smiths carefully separated metal from the dirty fires that birthed it.\n\nThis worldview shaped more than metallurgy. It shaped myth, philosophy, and the human imagination. Strength meant purification. Value meant separation. Immortality meant removing what was earthly.\n\nThis was the metallurgical worldview into which steel would fall like a star.",
  "falling-star": "Before iron could be smelted from ore, before it was extracted from sand, steel blades were made of fallen stars.\n\nFallen starlight—meteor iron carrying the elements of steel—entered human hands and rewrote our myths. In the poetic landscape of life and nature, the only heavenly touchdowns are fallen meteors. One in twenty are metallic: iron with a little nickel, a variety of trace ingredients, and a carbon signature.\n\nMeteors were the first real source of iron. Raw iron or steel was the option. Meteors could fall anywhere, at any time. Extracting metals from the earth could be centralized and scheduled; the quest for fallen starlight could not.\n\nLike the dagger found between King Tut’s thighs, our first blades of steel came as sparks from the sky. When blacksmiths stole light from the heavens, they forged the world’s strongest metals.\n\nThe Iron Age did not begin in mines. It began in the sky.",
  "impact-crater": "The shooting star is tracked to its impact crater.\n\nWhat begins as celestial disruption becomes earthly process. The stone is retrieved from the margins and brought into the furnace. It is gestated in a furnace tower, entering the smithy and the heat of transformation.\n\nThis moment marks the crossing from heaven to earth, from celestial object to human technology. The world it disrupts becomes the world that must now learn to work it.\n\nThe technical sequence begins: impact, furnace, hammer, preserved carbon, quench, repeat, draw.\n\nThe star has fallen. Now it must be worked.",
  "forge": "Unlocking iron and steel required hotter fires than any metal before them. Yet heat alone was not enough.\n\nWhen hammered into form, the behaviors of steel began to emerge. But iron alone was not yet the final metal. Something unexpected happened in the forge.\n\nSteel is stronger iron. The difference is carbon.\n\nCarbon had been a problem for smiths for thousands of years. Soot contaminated and compromised earlier metals. This same impurity, however, made iron stronger. What had been experienced as a corrosive element became a magic ingredient.\n\nInstead of separating metal from charcoal, smiths heated their iron by plunging it directly into carbon-rich embers. When heated with charcoal, carbon moves into the blade. For iron to be full strength, it demands carbon. Its carbon must be preserved.\n\nFor the first time in metallurgical history, strength came not from purification, but from inclusion.\n\nThe forge no longer removed impurity. It integrated it.",
  "quenching": "To progress from bronze to steel required hotter fires and rapid cooling.\n\nUnlocking steel and iron required hotter fires like all metals before them, but they only surpassed bronze when quenched. When hot steel is plunged into cool liquid, rapid cooling creates a hard skin that holds an edge. Before quenching, steel was already strong. Quenched, it became harder.\n\nPrecious metals had been unlocked by fire. The hard skin of iron—and its sharp edge—came from quenching.\n\nYet quenching carried a hidden truth.\n\nSteel is not harder where it is held when quenched. The spot grasped by the tongs tempers unevenly and remains soft. The same process that creates invincible armor creates a single weakness.\n\nThe hot steel is quenched. The process repeats.\n\nStrength and vulnerability are forged together.",
  "integration": "The emergence of steel disrupted more than metallurgy. It disrupted the philosophy of metals.\n\nFor thousands of years, precious metals had been strengthened through purification. With steel, the superior metal was not strengthened through purification. It was strengthened through inclusion.\n\nSteel is stronger than iron. The difference is carbon. This was transformational. What had been impurity became the magic ingredient.\n\nInstead of separating metal from earth, the new metal demanded it. Steel reflects strength in the form of inclusion.\n\nThe integration of dirt—and meteor—reversed the ancient paradigm of purity. Where the immortality of gold comes from separation, the strength of steel comes from inclusion.\n\nThis reversal mapped a different journey.",
  "drawing": "After repeated heating and quenching, the blade enters its final shaping.\n\nThe blade is ground, sharpened, polished into a mirror and assembled. Its surface becomes reflective. Its edge becomes precise. Its form becomes complete.\n\nFinally, it is drawn.\n\nThe process that began in the sky ends in the hand.",
  "new-age": "When the Age of Iron rose from its ashes, the spark it recalled was meteor steel.\n\nThe emergence of steel on the battlefield was one of the most disruptive technological developments in history. Steel changed the course of civilization. The technical process of working steel from the sky produced a narrative sequence that created new myths, rewrote our stories, and reshaped our worldviews.\n\nThe world responded—and transformed.\n\nThe Complete Sequence:\n\nInto the age of precious metals falls a light from the heavens.\nThe shooting star is tracked to its impact crater.\nIt is gestated in a furnace tower.\nHammered into shape but not overworked.\nIts carbon is preserved.\nThe hot steel is quenched.\nThe process repeats.\nThe blade is ground, sharpened, polished into a mirror and assembled.\nFinally, it is drawn.\n\nAnd the world changes."
